That is, each complete picture in the series that forms the video is examined. You can also have Video Intelligence annotate a video, or video segment, according to each shot that it detects in the input video.\nannotates a video with video segments that are generated when detecting abrupt shot changes in the video. In the output annotation, the beginning frame of each video segment indicates an abrupt shot change (i.e., the frames before and after that frame are visually different).\nTo detect shot changes in a video, call the [annotate](/video-intelligence/docs/reference/rest/v1/videos/annotate) method and specify [SHOT_CHANGE_DETECTION](/video-intelligence/docs/reference/rest/v1/videos#Feature) in the `features` field.\nCheck out the [Video Intelligence API visualizer](https://zackakil.github.io/video-intelligence-api-visualiser/#Shot%20Detection) to see this feature in action.\nFor examples, see [Analyzing Videos for Shot Changes](/video-intelligence/docs/analyze-shots) and the [Shot Change Detection Tutorial](/video-intelligence/docs/shot_detection) ", "content": ".", "guide": "Cloud Video Intelligence API"}
