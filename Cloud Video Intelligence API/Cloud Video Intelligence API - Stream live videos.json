Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nThis page describes how to annotate a video stream from standard live streaming protocols.\nThe Video Intelligence API Streaming API enables real-time streaming analysis for live media. Supported features include:\n- Live Label Detection\n- Live Shot Change Detection\n- Live Explicit Content Detection\n- Live Object Detection and Tracking\nThe [AIStreamer](https://github.com/google/aistreamer/tree/master/ingestion) ingestion library provides a set of open source interfaces and example code to connect to the Video Intelligence API Streaming API. The library supports:\n- HTTP Live Streaming (HLS): an HTTP based media streaming and communication protocol.\n- Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP): a network control protocol for streaming media servers. It is used in conjunction with Real Time Protocol (RTP) and Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP).\n- Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP): a protocol for streaming audio, video, and data over the Internet.", "content": "## To start using AIStreamer\nThe AIStreamer ingestion library includes the following examples (incuding a Docker example).\n- [Live Streaming](/video-intelligence/docs/streaming/live-streaming) : Instructions for supporting live streaming protocols (HLS, RTSP and RTMP) in Video Intelligence API.\n- [Docker & Kubernetes](/video-intelligence/docs/streaming/docker-kubernetes) : Instructions for using our docker example and kubernetes deployment.\n- [Live Label Detection](/video-intelligence/docs/streaming/live-label-detection) : Instructions for streaming label analysis.\n- [Live Shot Change Detection](/video-intelligence/docs/streaming/live-shot-change-detection) : Instructions for streaming shot change analysis.\n- [Live Explicit Content Detection](/video-intelligence/docs/streaming/live-explicit-content) : Instructions for streaming explicit content analysis.\n- [Live Object Detection and Tracking](/video-intelligence/docs/streaming/live-object-tracking) : Instructions for streaming object detection and tracking analysis.## Code architecture\nThe AIStreamer ingestion library includes the following three directories:\n- [client](https://github.com/google/aistreamer/tree/master/ingestion/client) : Python & C++ client libraries for connecting to Video Intelligence.\n- [env](https://github.com/google/aistreamer/tree/master/ingestion/env) : Docker example for AIStreamer ingestion.\n- [proto](https://github.com/google/aistreamer/tree/master/ingestion/proto) : Proto definitions and gRPC interface for Video Intelligence.## Third-party dependencies\nThe open source AIStreamer ingestion library is based on the following Google-owned and third-party open source libraries.\n- [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) : A build and test tool with multi-language support.\n- [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) : A high performance, open-source universal RPC framework.\n- [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) : Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.\n- [rules_protobuf](https://github.com/pubref/rules_protobuf) : Bazel rules for building protocol buffers and gRPC services.\n- [glog](https://github.com/google/glog) : C++ implementation of the Google logging module.\n- [gflags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags) : C++ library that implements command-line flags processing.\n- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) : A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.\n- [gStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) : Another cross-platform multimedia processing and streaming framework.", "guide": "Cloud Video Intelligence API"}
