{"title": "Cloud Video Intelligence API - Object tracking", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/feature-object-tracking", "abstract": "# Cloud Video Intelligence API - Object tracking\ncan track multiple objects detected in an input video or video segments and return labels (tags) associated with the detected entities along with the location of the entity in the frame.\n**Note:** There is a limit on the size of the detected objects. Very small objects in the video might not get detected.\nObject tracking differs from [label detection](/video-intelligence/docs/analyze-labels) . While label detection provides labels for the entire frame (without bounding boxes), object tracking detects individual objects and provides a label along with a bounding box that describes the location in the frame for each object. For example, a video of vehicles crossing an intersection may produce labels such as \"car\" , \"truck\", \"bike\", \"tires\", \"lights\", \"window\" and so on. Each label includes a series of bounding boxes showing the location of the object in the frame. Each bounding box also has an associated time segment with a time offset (timestamp) that indicates the duration offset from the beginning of the video. The annotation also contains additional entity information including an entity id that you can use to find more information about that entity in the [Google Knowledge Graph Search API](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/) .\nTo make an object tracking request, call the [annotate](/video-intelligence/docs/reference/rest/v1p2beta1/videos/annotate) method and specify [OBJECT_TRACKING](/video-intelligence/docs/reference/rest/v1p2beta1/videos#Feature) in the `features` field.\nCheck out the [Video Intelligence API visualizer](https://zackakil.github.io/video-intelligence-api-visualiser/#Object%20Tracking) to see this feature in action.\nFor an example, see [Object Tracking](/video-intelligence/docs/object-tracking) and [Shot Change Detection](/video-intelligence/docs/shot-detection) tutorial", "content": ".", "guide": "Cloud Video Intelligence API"}
