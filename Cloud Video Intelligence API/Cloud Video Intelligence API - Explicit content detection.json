Adult content is generally inappropriate for those under 18 years of age and includes, but is not limited to, nudity, sexual activities, and pornography. Such content detected in cartoons or anime is also identified.\nExplicit content detection annotates a video with explicit content annotations (tags) for entities that are detected in the video or video segments provided. The response returns a video frame timestamp where the explicit content is detected.\nTo detect explicit content in a video, call the [annotate](/video-intelligence/docs/reference/rest/v1/videos/annotate) method and specify [EXPLICIT_CONTENT_DETECTION](/video-intelligence/docs/reference/rest/v1/videos#Feature) in the `features` field.\nCheck out the [Video Intelligence API visualizer](https://zackakil.github.io/video-intelligence-api-visualiser/#Explicit%20Content%20Detection) to see this feature in action.\nFor an example, see [Analyzing Videos for Explicit Content](/video-intelligence/docs/analyze-safesearch) ", "content": ".", "guide": "Cloud Video Intelligence API"}
