These methods are asynchronous, and the operation may not be completed when the method returns a response.\n**Note:** Video Intelligence API does not support the `PageToken` , or `pageSize` parameters.\n", "content": "## Get an operation status\nYou can check the status of a long-running task ( [detecting shot changes](/video-intelligence/docs/analyze-shots) ) using the operation name.\n**Note:** When using the Web UI you can monitor the status in the **Status** column of the list page.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : the`name`field returned  from the call to Video Intelligence API. This is a value in the format:`projects/` `` `/locations/` `` `/operations/` ``,where:- is the [number](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) of your Google Cloud project,\n- is the cloud region where annotation took place (for  example:`us-east1`,`us-west1`,`europe-west1`,`asia-east1`),\n- is the ID of the long-running operation.HTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://videointelligence.googleapis.com/v1/OPERATION_NAME\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/operations/OPERATION_ID\",\n \"metadata\": {\n \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.videointelligence.v1p3beta1.AnnotateVideoProgress\",\n \"annotationProgress\": [  {\n  \"inputUri\": \"INPUT_URI\",\n  \"progressPercent\": 100,\n  \"startTime\": \"2020-05-12T19:36:09.110351Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2020-05-12T19:36:17.519069Z\"\n  }\n ]\n },\n \"done\": true,\n \"response\": {\n \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.videointelligence.v1p3beta1.AnnotateVideoResponse\",\n \"annotationResults\": [  {\n  ...\n  }\n ]\n }\n}\n```\n## Cancel an operation\nYou can cancel a long-running operation using the operation ID. However, cancellation is not guaranteed to succeed.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : provided in the response when you started the operation,for example`3326639765503758657`from`projects/754177431483/locations/us-west1/operations/3326639765503758657`\n- Note:- : your GCP project ID\n- : the Cloud region where annotation   should take place. Supported cloud regions are:`us-east1`,`us-west1`,`europe-west1`,`asia-east1`. If no region is specified, a region   will be determined based on video file location.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPOST https://videointelligence.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/operations/OPERATION_ID:cancel\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a successful status code (2xx) and an empty response.", "guide": "Cloud Video Intelligence API"}
