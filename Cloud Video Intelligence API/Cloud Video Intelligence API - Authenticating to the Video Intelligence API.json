(These credential-related mechanisms are known as schemes.)\n**Note:** Authentication and authorization are large topics. How you set up your application or service depends on a variety of factors, including who, or what application, you want to authenticate, what tasks you want to allow the authenticated entity to perform (commonly referred to as authorization), and what, if any, container you use\u2014for example, Compute Engine or App Engine. See the [Google Cloud Platform Auth Guide](/docs/authentication) for more information.\nGoogle Cloud API authentication and authorization (commonly grouped together as \"auth\") is typically done using a service account. A service account allows your code to send application credentials directly to the Video Intelligence API. A service account, like a user account, is represented by an email address. Unlike a user account, a service account is associated only with an application.\n", "content": "## Enabling the API\nBefore you can authenticate, you must first enable the Video Intelligence API.\n## Creating a service account in the Google Cloud console\nTo create a service account using the Google Cloud console, do the following:\n- From the Google Cloud console [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page, select **Create credentials > Service account key** .\n- Next, under **Service account** select **New service account** .\n- In the **Service account name** box, enter a name for your service account. This name is used as the default name for your **Serviceaccount ID** (to the left of the \"@\" in the generated service account ID address), but you can change this service account ID name. These names are arbitrary; it is only important that you remember them.\n- Under **Key type** select **JSON** for most new projects.\n- Click **Create** .\nThe Google Cloud console then generates a JSON key (as a `.json` text file), prompts you to download the file to your computer, and displays a **Service account created** dialog box.\nThe generated JSON key will be similar to the following sample JSON key:\n```\n{\n \"type\": \"service_account\",\n \"project_id\": \"PROJECT_ID\",\n \"private_key_id\": \"SOME_NUMBER\",\n \"private_key\": \"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nPRIVATE_KEY\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\",\n \"client_email\": \"SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL\",\n \"client_id\": \"...\",\n \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\n \"token_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token\",\n \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\",\n \"client_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL\"\n}\n```\nStore this JSON file securely, as it contains your private key (and this file is the only copy of that key). You must refer to this service account key file within your code when you send annotation requests to Video Intelligence API.\n## Authenticating with Application Default Credentials\nThe simplest way for applications to authenticate to Video Intelligence API is by using [Application Default Credentials](/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials) (ADC). Services using ADC first search for credentials within a `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. Unless you specifically require ADC to use other credentials (for example, user credentials), you should set this environment variable to point to your service account key file (the `.json` file downloaded when you created a service account key.\n```\n$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=PATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE\n```", "guide": "Cloud Video Intelligence API"}
