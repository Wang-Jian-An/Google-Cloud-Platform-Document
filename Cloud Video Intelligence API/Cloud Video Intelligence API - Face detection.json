To enable this feature, set the `includeBoundingBoxes` field in the [FaceDetectionConfig](/video-intelligence/docs/reference/rest/v1/videos/annotate#facedetectionconfig) to `True` .\n- Optional: the detected attributes of the face. To enable attribute detection set the `includeAttributes` field within [FaceDetectionConfig](/video-intelligence/docs/reference/rest/v1/videos/annotate#facedetectionconfig) to `True` . (note: You must also set `includeBoundingBoxes` to `True` ).
