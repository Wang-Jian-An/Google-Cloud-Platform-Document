This functionality is supported for both the general purpose CVS and the CVS-Performance [service types](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/service-types) . You can't revert a volume that is in a replication relationship.\n**Important:** Using a snapshot to revert a volume to a prior state is destructive. The system permanently deletes any snapshots taken after the snapshot you used to revert the volume. The revert operation cannot be undone.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Snapshots** page.\n- On the snapshot you want to revert to, click more_vert under **Show More** , and then select **Revert** . \n- In the **Revert Volume** dialog, click **Revert** . A dialog warns you that the revert action can't be undone. \n- To confirm the revert operation, type the volume name and click **Confirm** .", "content": "## What's next\n- [Restore a snapshot to a new volume](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/back-up) \n- [Security considerations](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/security-considerations) \n- [FAQs about NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/faqs-netapp)", "guide": "Cloud Architecture Center"}
