The replication price is based on the scheduled replication frequency. For more information, see the pricing section on the [NetApp Cloud Volumes Service page](https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-GCP) .\nReplication pricing is based on the number of bytes transferred between primary and secondary volumes, including initial baseline transfer of all primary data, incremental transfer of data changed on or added to the primary volume, and any other transfer, such as a resync or reverse sync. Regular storage capacity charges apply to the replication destination volume.\nThe volume replication amount billed in a month is based on the amount of data replicated through the volume replication feature during that month. The amount of data replicated, measured in GiB, represents the sum of data replicated across two regions during all regular replications from the source volumes to the destination volumes and during all resync replications from the destination volumes to the source volumes.\nThe following example demonstrates the pricing for a volume replication scenario.\n**Assumptions**\n- Primary volume is allocated 1 TiB at Premium service level.\n- Secondary volume is allocated 1 TiB at Standard service level.\n- Replication schedule is set to daily frequency.\n- Daily change rate is 1% (10.24 GiB of data changes on the primary volume every day and is replicated to the secondary volume).\n- Bytes transferred may vary somewhat due to storage efficiency savings and protocol overhead.\n**First month charges**\n- Primary capacity allocated: 1024 GiB * $0.30/GiB = $307.20\n- Secondary capacity allocated: 1024 GiB * $0.20/GiB = $204.80\n- Replication charges- Initial baseline: 1024 GiB * $0.14/GiB = $143.36\n- Daily changes (30 days): 307.2 GiB * $0.14/GiB = $43.01\n- Total charges (capacity plus replication): $698.97\n**Subsequent month charges**\n- Primary capacity allocated: 1024 GiB * $0.30/GiB = $307.20\n- Secondary capacity allocated: 1024 GiB * $0.20/GiB = $204.80\n- Replication charges- Daily changes (30 days): 307.2 GiB * $0.14/GiB = $43.01\n- Total charges (capacity plus replication): $555.01", "guide": "Cloud Architecture Center"}
