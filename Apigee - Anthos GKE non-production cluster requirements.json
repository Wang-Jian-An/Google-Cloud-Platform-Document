For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\nThis section describes the basic requirements for setting up a non-production cluster on [Anthos GKE](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/) (previously known as [GKE On-Prem](https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem/docs/overview) ).\nA non-production configuration typically includes fewer nodes, consumes fewer  resources, and runs in fewer zones or regions than a production cluster. Non-production clusters are commonly used for demonstration and development purposes.\n", "content": "## \n Creating the cluster\nFor information about creating Anthos GKE clusters, see [Creating admin and user clusters](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke/docs/on-prem/1.5/how-to/admin-user-cluster-basic) in the Anthos GKE on-prem 1.5 documentation.\n## Non-production cluster requirements\nUse these requirements as a guide when creating your non-production cluster.\n### Software requirements\n| Requirement  | Value             |\n|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Anthos GKE version | Version 1.1.1-gke.2 or later        |\n| kubectl version | Version 1.13.x or later. See Install and Set Up kubectl. |\n### Node requirements\nYou must configure and label two types of nodes in your cluster -- one for the stateful Cassandra pods and one for the rest of the pods, which are stateless. Configure these node types as described below:\n| Requirement    | Value                      |\n|:------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Minimum number of nodes | 3                       |\n| Node specifications  | 8 CPU (Minimum) 16 GB Ram (Minimum)              |\n| Kubernetes label  | Name: apigee.com/apigee-nodepool Value: apigee-data See How to label the worker nodes. |\n| Storage     | Dynamically provisioned.                 |\n| Requirement    | Value                      |\n|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Minimum number of nodes | 3                       |\n| Node specifications  | 8 CPU (Minimum) 16 GB Ram (Minimum)               |\n| Kubernetes label  | Name: apigee.com/apigee-nodepool Value: apigee-runtime See How to label the worker nodes. |\n| Storage     | Dynamically provisioned.                  |", "guide": "Apigee"}
