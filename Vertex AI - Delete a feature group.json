{"title": "Vertex AI - Delete a feature group", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform", "abstract": "# Vertex AI - Delete a feature group\nWhen you delete a feature group, you automatically unregister any BigQuery data sources that were registered for that feature group. If the feature group contains existing features, you can use the `force` query parameter to delete the feature group. Deleting a feature group unregisters the BigQuery table or view from the Feature Registry and doesn't affect the feature data contained in those data sources.\nUse the following samples to delete a feature group along with its features.\nUse the following instructions to delete a feature group and all its features using the Google Cloud console.- In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to the **Feature Store** page. [Go to the Feature Store page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/feature-store) \n- In the **Feature groups** section, select checkbox next to the feature group that you want to delete.\n- Click **Delete** and then click **Confirm** .\nTo delete a [FeatureGroup](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups#resource:-featuregroup) resource, send a `DELETE` request by using the [featureGroups.delete](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups/delete) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the feature group is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the feature group that you want to delete.\n- : Optional: To delete the feature group even if it contains features,  enter`true`. The default value is`false`.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nDELETE https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME?force=BOOLEAN\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X DELETE \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME?force=BOOLEAN\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\n$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token$headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $cred\" }Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method DELETE ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME?force=BOOLEAN\" | Select-Object -Expand Content\n```\nYou should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/operations/OPERATION_ID\",\n \"metadata\": {\n \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.DeleteOperationMetadata\",\n \"genericMetadata\": {\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-09-15T04:54:03.632646Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-09-15T04:54:03.632646Z\"\n }\n },\n \"done\": true,\n \"response\": {\n \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Empty\"\n }\n}\n```\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn how to [create a feature group](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featuregroup) .\n- Learn how to [update a feature group](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-featuregroup) .\n- Learn how to [delete a feature from a feature group](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/delete-feature) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
