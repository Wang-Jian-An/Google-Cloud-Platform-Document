You can also print instructions to the terminal to help users interact with the content.\nOpen in Cloud Shell links help developers experiment with your code samples and APIs without having to download the Google Cloud CLI, install required dependencies, or search for relevant source files. This page explains how to add an Open in Cloud Shell link to your Git repository.\n**Note:** Only GitHub and Bitbucket repositories are permitted by default. If you would like to add a different repository,with the repository type you'd like to use with.\n", "content": "## URL parameters\nAn Open in Cloud Shell link, optionally embedded in a button image, can be added to the README.md file of any directory in your Git repository. The recommended location for this link is the root README.md file of your Git repository.\n### Required URL parameter\nTo create this link, use a base URL of `shell.cloud.google.com` (or any page in the Google Cloud console that begins with `console.cloud.google.com` ) with the following required URL parameter:\n| URL Parameter  | Description                                       | Supported Values                                                             |\n|:--------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| cloudshell_git_repo | URL of the Git repository to clone. After the repository is cloned, the root of the project folder is opened, displaying its contents in the left navigation pane. | Valid URL for a Git repository. This URL consists of a permitted domain (GitHub or Bitbucket) and a path. The following characters are permitted: uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, underscores (_), hyphens (-), periods (.), and forward-slashes (/). |\n### Optional URL parameters\nYou can also specify any of the following optional parameters:\n| URL Parameter      | Description                                                                                                      | Supported Values                                                                                                              |\n|:------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| cloudshell_git_branch    | Branch from the Git repository to clone.
