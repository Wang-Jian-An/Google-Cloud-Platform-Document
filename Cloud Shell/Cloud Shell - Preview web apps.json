{"title": "Cloud Shell - Preview web apps", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview", "abstract": "# Cloud Shell - Preview web apps\nThis page describes how to use the web preview feature in Cloud Shell. This feature allows you to run web applications on the Cloud Shell virtual machine instance and preview them from the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) .\nThe Web Preview button can be found on the top right of the Cloud Shell taskbar.\n", "content": "## Start the web application\nYou can run any web application that listens to HTTP requests on the Cloud Shell virtual machine, including the App Engine development server. The web application must listen for HTTP requests on ports within the permitted range 2000 to 65000. These ports are only available to the secure Cloud Shell proxy service, which restricts access over HTTPS to your user account only.\n### Simple server example\nTo start a simple Python HTTP server from the Cloud Shell command prompt:\n```\ncd `mktemp -d` \\\n && echo '<html><body>Hello World</body></html>' >./index.html \\\n && python -m http.server 8080\n```\n### App Engine development server example\nTo clone a sample App Engine application and run it on the App Engine development server:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-guestbook-python \\\n && cd appengine-guestbook-python \\\n && dev_appserver.py ./app.yaml\n```\nThe development server runs on port 8080 by default.\n## Preview the application\nClick the **Web Preview** button and then select the port number from the displayed menu. Cloud Shell opens the preview URL on its proxy service in a new browser window.\nYou can also access the preview URL by combining the port with the environment variable `WEB_HOST` in the Cloud Shell terminal using the format `https://$PORT-$WEB_HOST` , or by using the [Cloud Shell API](/shell/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.shell.v1#environment) .", "guide": "Cloud Shell"}
