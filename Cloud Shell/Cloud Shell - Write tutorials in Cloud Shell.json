Cloud Shell creates in-context tutorials from these Markdown files by parsing the text into steps and substeps that are then displayed in a panel in Google Cloud console.\n", "content": "## Learn about tutorials (using a tutorial!)\nTo learn about interactive tutorials by working through an actual interactive tutorial, launch the tutorial on writing tutorials with the following button:\n[Open in Cloud Shell](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-shell-tutorials&page=editor&cloudshell_tutorial=tutorial.md)\n## Write tutorials\nTutorials are written in [CommonMark Markdown](http://commonmark.org/) . Additional [Markdown extensions](/shell/docs/cloud-shell-tutorials/markdown-extensions) are supported, as are [directives](#directives) , which include advanced functionality like [spotlighting features](/shell/docs/cloud-shell-tutorials/directives-spotlights) and adding [inline icons](/shell/docs/cloud-shell-tutorials/directives-layout#icons) .\n### Steps\nWhen creating a tutorial, headings are important in determining its structure. To set the correct title, step headings, and underlying instructions, use the following hierarchy:\n- H1 (#) tags for the tutorial title. There should only be one H1 tag in a tutorial.\n- H2 (\n##) tags for a step title.\n- H3 (\n###) tags for a sub-step title.\nHere is a sample Markdown file you can use to create a tutorial:\n```\n# First tutorial\n## First stepHello world\n### Part 1Part one instructions.\n### Part 2Part two instructions.\n## ConclusionDone!\n```\n### Directives\nDirectives enable advanced functionality like spotlighting features and adding inline icons.\nTo add a directive, use the following format:\n```\n<walkthrough-DIRECTIVE_NAME PARAMETER=\"PARAMETER_VALUE\"></walkthrough-DIRECTIVE_NAME>\n```\nFor example, if you'd like to use the directive `editor-open-file` and the parameter `filePath` , it would be written as follows:\n```\n<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath=\"test/hello.md\"></walkthrough-editor-open-file>\n```\nFor the available directives, refer to the [directives reference](/shell/docs/cloud-shell-tutorials/directives-cloud-shell-editor) .\n## Launch tutorials in Cloud Shell\nThere are two ways to kickstart a tutorial in Cloud Shell:\n- **Use the cloudshell launch-tutorial command** Run the following `cloudshell` command in your [Cloud Shell session](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell) to launch a tutorial from an existing Markdown file, `tutorial.md` :```\ncloudshell launch-tutorial tutorial.md\n```Alternatively, you can use the `teachme` alias by running the following command in your [Cloud Shell session](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell) to launch a tutorial from an existing file, `hello.md` :```\nteachme hello.md\n```\n- **Use Open in Cloud Shell** Alternatively, you can use the [Open in Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/open-in-cloud-shell) feature to guide your users from a website, blog, or open source project to your tutorial hosted in a Git repository. The feature allows for a `cloudshell_tutorial` parameter, which can be added to the end of the URL to specify the location of the source Markdown file in the repository. This means that the Markdown for a button linked to your tutorial would look like:```\n[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?cloudshell_git_repo=GIT_REPO_URL&cloudshell_tutorial=PATH_TO_MD_FILE)\n```## Next steps\n- For a comprehensive list of tutorial-specific Markdown expressions, see the [Tutorial Markdown reference](/shell/docs/cloud-shell-tutorials/markdown-extensions) .\n- For guidelines on how to write effective tutorials, see the [Tutorial style guide](/shell/docs/cloud-shell-tutorials/style-guide) .", "guide": "Cloud Shell"}
