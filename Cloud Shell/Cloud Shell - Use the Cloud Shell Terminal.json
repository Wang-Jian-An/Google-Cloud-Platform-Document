You can open multiple shell connections to the same instance.\nTo view the gcloud CLI available commands, run `gcloud --help` .\nIn addition to accessing the [Google Cloud CLI](/sdk/gcloud) and other utilities from the command line, you can use the `cloudshell` command to launch tutorials, open the Cloud Shell Editor, and download files.\nFor more information, run `cloudshell help` .\n### Scroll the display\nIn addition to using your mouse while browser focus is on a session tab, you can scroll by pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `PageUp` / `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `PageDn` (Windows and Linux) or `Fn` + `Shift` + `Up` / `Fn` + `Shift` + `Down` (on Mac OS X).\n### Copy and paste text\nTo copy and paste text:\n- Select some text in the session display or another window using your mouse.\n- To copy the text, press `Ctrl` + `C` (on Windows or Linux) or `Cmd` + `C` (on macOS).\n- To paste at your cursor location, press `Ctrl` + `V` (on Windows or Linux) or `Cmd` + `V` (on macOS).\n### Send a key combination using the Google Cloud console\nClick **Send Key Combination** and then press `Ctrl` + `V` .\n## Configure terminal settings\nTo adjust your terminal settings, click **Settings** . In this menu, you can set your Terminal preferences for theme, font type and size, and copy, keyboard and scrollbar default settings.\n### Keyboard layout support\nIf you're using an international keyboard or would like to customize your key bindings, Cloud Shell allows you to specify which key behaves as Alt Gr (your modifier key). To specify key mapping, go to the **Terminal Settings** menu, select **Terminal Preferences** > **Keyboard** > **Alt Gr Key** and choose one of the following options:\n- Auto - Autodetect based on browser language\n- None - Disable any AltGr related munging\n- Ctrl-Alt - Set Ctrl+Alt as AltGr\n- Left-Alt - Set left Alt as AltGr\n- Right-Alt - Set right Alt as AltGr\nAdditionally, you can set 'Alt is meta' to specify that your alt key should behave as a meta key.\n## Open multiple terminal sessions\nTo open additional sessions, click **Add Cloud Shell Session** at the top of the Cloud Shell window. Each session connects to the same virtual machine instance. When you open a new session, it appears in a new tab at the bottom of the Google Cloud console.\n## Tab title customization\nCloud Shell understands xterm escape sequences for [setting tab titles](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Xterm-Title-4.html#ss4.3) . To rename a tab title, set the `PS1` environment variable in your .bashrc to your desired configuration and source your .bashrc for the change to take.", "guide": "Cloud Shell"}
