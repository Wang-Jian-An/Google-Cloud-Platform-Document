If you attempt to start a new operation prematurely, the operation request fails. This includes instance restarts. The instance status in the Google Cloud console does not reflect whether an operation is running. The green check mark denotes only that the instance is in the RUNNABLE state. To see whether an operation is running, go to the Operations tab and check the status of the most recent operation.                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Configure storage to accommodate critical database maintenance.                     | If the enable automatic storage increases instance setting is disabled or the automatic storage increase limit is enabled, ensure you have at least 20% available space to accommodate any critical database maintenance operations that Cloud SQL may perform. To get alerted on available disk space falling below 20%, create a metrics-based alerting policy for the disk utilization metric with an above threshold position and a value of .8. For more information, see Create metrics-based alert policies.                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Prevent over-utilization of your CPU.                            | You can view the percentage of available CPU that your instance is using on the instance details page in the Google Cloud console. For more information, see Metrics. You can also monitor your CPU usage and receive alerts at a specified threshold using Create metric-threshold alerting policies. To avoid over-utilization, you can increase the number of CPUs for your instance. Changing CPUs requires an instance restart. If your instance is already at the maximum number of CPUs, you must shard your database to multiple instances.                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Avoid memory exhaustion.                               | When looking for signs of memory exhaustion, you should primarily use the usage metric. To avoid out-of-memory errors, we recommend that this metric remains below 90%. You can also use the total_usage metric to observe the percentage of available memory that your Cloud SQL instance is using, including memory used by the database container and memory allocated by the operating system cache. By observing the difference between the two metrics, you can identify how much memory is used by processes versus how much is used by the operating system cache. You can repurpose the memory in this cache. To predict out-of-memory issues, check both metrics and interpret them together. If the metrics appear high, the instance might be low in memory. This can be because of a custom configuration, the instance being undersized for the workload, or a combination of these factors. Scale your Cloud SQL instance to increase the size of its memory. Changing the instance's memory size requires an instance restart. If your instance is already at the maximum memory size, you must shard your database across multiple instances. To learn more about monitoring both metrics in the Google Cloud console, see Metrics. |\n| Make sure your instance has optimal transaction IDs.                        | You can view the transaction ID usage of your instance on the Metrics Explorer page in the Google Cloud console by setting the Resource Type as Cloud SQL Database and Metric as Percentage of instance's transaction IDs consumed. For more information, see Create charts with Metrics Explorer. Tuning and monitoring database instances can help to reduce or avoid vacuum-related problems. Monitor the transaction ID usage of your instance and enable and adjust autovacuum parameters according to the workload on your instance. For more information, see Overcome transaction ID (TXID) wraparound protection.                                                                                                                                                         |\n## Data architecture\n| Best practice              | More information                                            |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Split your large instances into smaller instances, where possible. | When possible, using many smaller Cloud SQL instances is better than one large instance. Managing a large, monolithic instance presents challenges not posed by a group of smaller instances. |\n| Don't use too many database tables.        | Keep your instance's table count to fewer than 10,000. Too many database tables can impact database upgrade time.                    |\n## Application implementation\n| Best practice                           | More information                                                                                |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Use good connection management practices, such as connection pooling and exponential backoff.      | Using these techniques improves your application's use of resources and helps you stay within Cloud SQL connection limits. For more information and code samples, see Managing database connections.                                  |\n| Test your application's response to maintenance updates, which can happen at any time during the maintenance window. | Try self-service maintenance to simulate a maintenance update. During maintenance, your instance becomes unavailable for a brief period, and existing connections are dropped. Testing maintenance rollouts gives you a better understanding of how your application handles scheduled maintenance and how quickly the system can recover. |\n| Test your application's response to failovers, which can happen at any time.           | You can manually initiate a failover using the Google Cloud console, the gcloud CLI, or the API. See Initiating failover.                                                      |\n| Avoid large transactions.                        | Keep transactions small and short. If a large database update is needed, do it in several smaller transactions rather than one large transaction.                                                |\n| If you are using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, make sure you are using the most up-to-date version.      | See Keeping the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy up-to-date.                                                                        |\n## Data import and export\n| Best practice                    | More information                                                               |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Use serverless exports.                 | Serverless exports offload the export operation to a temporary instance, allowing the primary instance to continue to serve queries and perform operations at its usual performance. When the data export is complete, the temporary instance is automatically deleted. |\n| Speed up imports for small instance sizes.             | For small instances, you can temporarily increase the CPU and RAM of an instance to improve performance when importing large datasets.                                 |\n| If you are exporting data for import into Cloud SQL, be sure to use the proper procedure. | See Exporting data from an externally managed database server.                                                    |\n## Backup and recovery\n| Best practice              | More information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Protect your data with the appropriate Cloud SQL functionality. | Backups, point-in-time recovery, and exports are ways to provide data redundancy and protection. They each protect against different scenarios and complement each other in a robust data protection strategy. Backups are lightweight; they provide a way to restore the data on your instance to its state at the time you took the backup. However, backups have some limitations. If you delete the instance, the backups are also deleted. You can't back up a single database or table. And if the region where the instance is located is unavailable, you cannot restore the instance from that backup, even in an available region. Point-in-time recovery helps you recover an instance to a specific point in time. For example, if an error causes a loss of data, you can recover a database to its state before the error occurred. A point-in-time recovery always creates a new instance; you cannot perform a point-in-time recovery to an existing instance. Exports take longer to create, because an external file is created in Cloud Storage that can be used to recreate your data. Exports are unaffected if you delete the instance. In addition, you can export only a single database or even table, depending on the export format you choose. |\n| Size instances to account for transaction (binary) log retention. | High write activity to the database can generate a large volume of transaction (binary) logs, which can consume significant disk space, and lead to disk growth for instances enabled to increase storage automatically. We recommend sizing instance storage to account for transaction log retention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Protect your instance and backups from accidental deletion.  | A Cloud SQL instance that you create in the Google Cloud console or via Terraform enables accidental deletion prevention by default. Use the export feature in Cloud SQL to export your data for additional protection. Use Cloud Scheduler with the REST API to automate export management. For more advanced scenarios, Cloud Scheduler with Cloud Functions for automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n## Tune and monitor\nTuning and monitoring database instances can help in reducing or avoiding vacuum-related problems.\nThe `VACUUM` operation has different variants with different levels of locking: standard `VACUUM` and `VACUUM FULL` . The `VACUUM FULL` option can reclaim more disk space but exclusively locks the table and runs slowly. Instead, use the standard form of `VACUUM` , which can run in parallel with production database operations. When you use the `VACUUM` operation, commands such as `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE` will continue to function normally. You will not be able to modify the definition of a table with commands such as `ALTER TABLE` while it is being vacuumed.\nHere are some recommendations that might help in reducing the time it takes to complete the `VACUUM` operation:\n- Increase system memory and`maintenance_work_mem`.  This batches more tuples in each iteration and completes the work as  quickly as possible. Note that when autovacuum runs, up to`autovacuum_max_workers`times this memory may be allocated,  so be careful not to set the default value too high.\n- The`VACUUM`operation generates a lot of write-ahead log (WAL)  records. If it's possible to reduce the number of WAL records, such as by  having no replicas configured for this instance, the operation completes  more quickly.\n- If the table has reached the two billion transaction IDs limit because none  of the tuples is frozen, then try to reduce the amount of work done in  single-user mode. One possible option is to set`vacuum_freeze_min_age=1,000,000,000`(the maximum allowed  value, up from the default of 50,000,000). This new value reduces the  number of tuples frozen up to two times.\n- PostgreSQL version 12.0 and later versions support cleanup and`VACUUM`operations without cleaning the index entries. This is  crucial, as cleaning the index requires a complete index scan, and if  there are multiple indexes, then the total time depends on index size.\n- Larger indexes consume a significant amount of time for the index scan,  therefore`INDEX_CLEANUP OFF`is preferred to quickly clean up  and freeze the table data. PostgreSQL versions before 12.0 need to tune  the number of indexes. That is, if there are non-critical indexes, then it  might be helpful to drop the`NON-CRITICAL`index to speed up  the vacuum operation.## What's next\nFor more information about general practices by database engine, see:\n- [General best practices for MySQL](/sql/docs/mysql/best-practices) \n- [General best practices for PostgreSQL](/sql/docs/postgres/best-practices) \n- [General best practices for SQL Server](/sql/docs/sqlserver/best-practices)", "guide": "Cloud SQL"}
