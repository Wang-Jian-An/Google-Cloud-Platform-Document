{"title": "Cloud SQL - Migrate data to a Cloud SQL instance", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/migrate-data-to-cloud-sql-instance", "abstract": "# Cloud SQL - Migrate data to a Cloud SQL instance\nYou can use [Database Migration Service](/database-migration/docs) to create a destination Cloud SQL database instance as part of [creating a migration job](/database-migration/docs/postgres/create-migration-job-intro) . Database Migration Service uses migration jobs to migrate data from your source database instance to the destination instance. For more information, see [Create a migration job to a new destination instance](/database-migration/docs/postgres/create-migration-job) .\nHowever, you might want to create your destination database instance outside of Database Migration Service (for example, to accommodate database creation processes that use Terraform or other Infrastructure-As-Code (IaC) Tools). After creating the instance, use Database Migration Service to migrate data to it. For more information, see [Create a migration job to an existing destination instance](/database-migration/docs/postgres/create-migration-job-existing-instance) .\n", "content": "## Limitations\n- Migrating data to a Cloud SQL instance that has a [read replica](/sql/docs/postgres/replication#read-replicas) , has [Private Service Connect](/sql/docs/postgres/about-private-service-connect) enabled, or already contains data isn't supported.\n- If your instance has customized backup settings (for example, a [custom backup location](/sql/docs/postgres/backup-recovery/backing-up#locationbackups) ), then after you promote the instance, we recommend that you customize your backup settings again. During the promotion process, Cloud SQL resets your backup settings to their default values.\n- After you promote an instance, we recommend that you enable [point-in-time recovery](/sql/docs/postgres/backup-recovery/pitr) .", "guide": "Cloud SQL"}
