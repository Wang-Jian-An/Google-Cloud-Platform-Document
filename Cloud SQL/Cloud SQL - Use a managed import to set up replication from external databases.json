If you use the logical replication and decoding features in Cloud SQL, replication slots are created and dropped automatically. Unused replication slots can be detected by querying the pg_replication_slots system view and filtering on the active column. Unused slots can be dropped to remove WAL segments using the pg_drop_replication_slot command.                                                                                                       |\n| The replica instance is using too much memory.   | The replica uses temporary memory to cache often-requested read operations, which can lead it to use more memory than the primary instance.

Replication lag takes place when the SQL thread on a replica is unable to keep up with the IO thread. Some kinds of queries or workloads can cause temporary or permanent high replication lag for a given schema. Some of the typical causes of replication lag are: Slow queries on the replica. Find and fix them. All tables must have a unique/primary key. Every update on such a table without a unique/primary key causes full table scans on th replica. Queries like DELETE ... WHERE field < 50000000 cause replication lag with row-based replication since a huge number of updates are piled up on the replica. Some possible solutions include: Edit the instance to increase the size of the replica. Reduce the load on the database. Send read traffic to the read replica. Index the tables. Identify and fix slow write queries. Recreate the replica. |\n| Errors when rebuilding indexes in PostgreSQL 9.6.  | You get an error from PostgreSQL informing you that you need to rebuild a particular index. This can be done only on the primary instance. If you create a new replica instance, you soon get the same error again. Hash indexes are not propagated to replicas in PostgreSQL versions below 10. If you must use hash indexes, upgrade to PostgreSQL 10+. Otherwise, if you also want to use replicas, don't use hash indexes in PostgreSQL 9.6.                                                                                                                      |\n| Query on the primary instance is always running.  | After creating a replica, the query SELECT * from pg_stat_activity where state = 'active' and pid = XXXX and username = 'cloudsqlreplica' is expected to run continuously on your primary instance.                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Replica creation fails with timeout.     | Long-running uncommitted transactions on the primary instance can cause read replica creation to fail.
