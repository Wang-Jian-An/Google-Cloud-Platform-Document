The resources created in this quickstart typically cost less than a dollar, assuming you complete the steps, including the clean up, in a timely manner.To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the Google Cloud console, click **Guide me** :\n [Guide me](https://console.cloud.google.com/?walkthrough_id=sql--mysql--quickstart-private-ip) ", "content": "## Before you begin **Note:** The name you use for your project must be between 4 and 30 characters. When you type the name, the form suggests a project ID, which you can edit. The project ID must be between 6 and 30 characters, with a lowercase letter as the first character. You can use a dash, lowercase letter, or digit for the remaining characters, but the last character cannot be a dash.- Enable the necessary Google Cloud APIs.\nIn the Google Cloud console, go to the **APIs** page.\n [Go to APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis) \nEnable the Cloud SQL Admin API. By enabling this API, you can run the  Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.\nClick the following button to open Cloud Shell, which provides   command-line access to your Google Cloud resources directly from the browser.   Cloud Shell can be used to run the `gcloud` commands presented throughout this quickstart.\n [Open Cloud Shell](/console/sql/instances?cloudshell=true) \nRun the [gcloud services enable](/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/enable) command   as follows using Cloud Shell to enable the APIs required for this quickstart.:\n```\ngcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com\n```\nThis command enables the following APIs:- Cloud SQL Admin API. By enabling this API, you can run the  Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.\n## OverviewThere are many ways to connect to a Cloud SQL instance with a private IP address, depending on where the source is located. The key factor is that the source machine must be in the same VPC network as the Cloud SQL instance. If the source is not in Google Cloud or not in the same Google Cloud project, then you have to [configure connectivity](/sql/docs/mysql/configure-private-ip#vpn) differently than we show here.\nIn this quickstart, we configure connectivity through the most direct path. The source and target are in the same Google Cloud project and in the same VPC network. We create a Cloud SQL instance with a private IP address (the target) and a Compute Engine VM (the source). We use the VM to install and use the tools required to connect from the VM to the Cloud SQL instance.\nPerform the following actions:- [Create a Cloud SQL instance with a privateIP address](#create-instance) .Find and save the instance's `connection name` for later use.\n- [Create a Compute Engine VM](#create-vm) .\n- [Open two SSH connections to the Compute Engine VM](#open-ssh) .You'll use the first window to install the mysql and install and start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy. Then you'll use the second window to connect to the Cloud SQL instance by connecting to the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.\n- In SSH window #1, do the following:- [Install the mysql client](#install-client) .\n- [Install the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy](#install-proxy) .The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy acts as a connector between the mysql client and the Cloud SQL instance.\n- [Start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy](#start-proxy) .On success, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy listens for connection requests.\n- In SSH window #2, [connect to the Cloud SQLinstance](#connect) by having the mysql client connect to the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.On success, you see your mysql prompt in this window, and a successful connection message in SSH window #1, where the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is running.\n- [Clean up](#clean-up) .\n## Create a Cloud SQL instance with a private IP address\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud SQL Instances** page. [Go to Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql) \n- Click **Create Instance** .\n- Click **Choose MySQL** .\n- If you're prompted to enable the **Compute API** , click the **Enable API** button.\n- In the **Instance info** section, enter a name for the **Instance ID** .\n- Enter a password for the root user. Take note of the password  you create, because you need it later.\n- In the **Choose region and zonal availability** section, select the **Single zone** option.\n- Expand **Show configuration options** .\n- Expand **Connections** .\n- Clear **Public IP** .\n- Select **Private IP** .\n- From the **Network** dropdown, select **default** .\n- If you're using a new project, you're prompted by the message: **Private service connection required** . Then follow these steps:\n- Click **Set up connection** .\n- Click **Enable service networking API** .\n- In the **Allocate an IP range** section, select **Use an automatically allocated IP range** .\n- Click **Continue** .\n- Click **Create connection** and wait for connection creation to  complete.\n- Click **Create instance** .\nYou're taken to the instance Overview page. Click into the new instance view the details including its private IP address.\nIn the **Connect to this instance** section, copy and save the instance's **Connection name** . The `connection name` is in the format `projectID:region:instanceID` .\nYou'll use this `connection name` later when starting the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.## Create a Compute Engine VM\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **VM instances** page. [Go to VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) \n- Click **Create instance** .\n- Enter a **Name** for the instance.\n- In **Access scopes** , select **Allow full access to all Cloud APIs** .\n- Click **Create** and wait for the VM to finish being created.\n## Open two SSH connections to the Compute Engine VMWe use two windows in the VM. The first window is used to install the mysql client and the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, get the instance connection name, and use this name to start the proxy. The second window is used to connect to the Cloud SQL instance through the proxy.- Expand the **SSH** menu in the **Connect** column for your  Compute Engine VM instance.\n- Select **Open in browser window** to open SSH window #1.It might take a few seconds for the prompt in the window to become  available for you.\n- When the prompt appears, enter`pwd`to verify that you're  in the`/home/$USER`directory.You'll install the mysql client and the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, and also start  the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, in this window.\n- Select **Open in browser window** again to open SSH window #2.You'll use this window to connect to your Cloud SQL instance.\n## Install the mysql clientUse SSH window #1 for this step.\nInstall the MySQL client from the package manager and stop the `mysqld` server:\n```\nsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install mariadb-client-10.6\u00a0 \n```\n## Install the Cloud SQL Auth ProxyUse SSH window #1 for this step.- Install`wget`:```\nsudo apt-get install wget\u00a0 \u00a0 \n```\n- Download the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy:```\nwget https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-sql-connectors/cloud-sql-proxy/v2.8.2/cloud-sql-proxy.linux.amd64 \\-O cloud-sql-proxy\u00a0 \n```\n- Make the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy executable:```\nchmod +x cloud-sql-proxy\u00a0 \n```\n## Start the Cloud SQL Auth ProxyUse SSH window #1 for this step.\nStart the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy so you can monitor its output. Replace `INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME` with the `connection name` you copied when you created the Cloud SQL instance.\n```\n./cloud-sql-proxy --private-ip INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME\n```\n **Note:** By default, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy attempts to connect to your Cloud SQL instance using a public IPv4 address. If the instance has only private IP or the instance has both public and private IP configured, and you want the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to use the private IP address, you must provide the `--private-ip` option when you start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.If you see an error that the address is already in use, it means that a local instance of the database is running, and you need to stop it. Find the `SERVICE_NAME` by running the command `ps -ef | grep mysql` and then run the command:```\nsudo service SERVICE_NAME stop\u00a0 \n```\nWhen the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy starts successfully, a message similar to the following appears in the SSH window:\n```\nListening on 127.0.0.1:3306 for myInstance\nReady for new connections\n```## Connect to your Cloud SQL instanceUse SSH window #2 for this step.\nRun the following command:\n```\nmysql -u root -p --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3306\n```\nAt the `Enter password:` prompt, enter the password of your MySQL root user account.\nVerify that the MySQL prompt appears. You have connected to your database using the mysql client.\nReturn to the terminal window where you started the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy. You should see a message similar to the following:\n`New connection for` ``## Clean upTo avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for   the resources used on this page, follow these steps.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud SQL Instances** page.
