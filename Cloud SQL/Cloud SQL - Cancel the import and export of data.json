You need to specify this ID in the `gcloud` or REST API command so that Cloud SQL knows which operation to cancel.The operation ID is returned in the `name` field of the response. To obtain this ID, see [Export and import using SQL dump files](/sql/docs/postgres/import-export/import-export-sql) .You can also find the operation ID by making an [operations.list](/sql/docs/postgres/admin-api/rest/v1beta4/operations/list) call on the  Cloud SQL instance.\n## Cancel the import or export operation\nYou can use `gcloud` or REST API commands to cancel an import or export operation.\nUse the\n`gcloud sql operations cancel`\ncommand to cancel the operation.\n```\ngcloud sql operations cancel operation-ID\n```\nReplace the\nvariable with the ID of the operation.
