{"title": "Cloud SQL - Create read replicas", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/replication/create-replica", "abstract": "# Cloud SQL - Create read replicas\nThis page describes how to create a read replica for a Cloud SQL instance.\nA read replica is a copy of the primary instance that reflects changes to the primary in almost real time, in normal circumstances. You can use a read replica to offload read requests or analytics traffic from the primary instance.\nAdditionally, for disaster recovery, you can perform a regional migration. If a replica is a [cross-region replica](/sql/docs/postgres/replication/cross-region-replicas) , you can perform a failover to another region; specifically, you can promote a replica to a standalone instance (in which case, existing replicas would not consider that instance as primary).\nFor more information about how replication works, see [Replication in Cloud SQL](/sql/docs/postgres/replication) .\n", "content": "## Before you begin\nIf you are creating the first replica for this instance, ensure that the instance meets the requirements for primary instances. [Learn more](/sql/docs/postgres/replication#requirements) .\n## Create a read replica\nThe steps for creating a read replica are below.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud SQL Instances** page. [Go to Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql) \n- Find the instance for which you want to create a replica, and then open the`more actions`menu at the far right of the listing.\n- Select **Create read replica** .If you don't see that choice, then the instance is a replica; you can't create  a replica of a replica.\n- In the **Customize your instance** section of the page,  update settings for your replica. Begin by clicking **Show configuration options** to display the groups of settings. Then, expand the desired groups to review  and customize the settings. A **Summary** of all the options you select  appears on the right. Customizing these settings is optional. Defaults are assigned  in every case where no customizations are made.For more details about each setting, see the [About instance settings](/sql/docs/postgres/instance-settings) page.For example, to allow other Google Cloud services, such as   BigQuery, to access data in Cloud SQL and make queries against   this data over an internal connection, expand the **Connections** group, and then   deselect the **Public IP** check box.\n- Click **Create replica** .Cloud SQL creates a backup, if needed, and creates the replica.  You are returned to the instance page for the primary.\nCreate the replica:\n```\ngcloud sql instances create REPLICA_NAME \\--master-instance-name=MASTER_INSTANCE_NAME\n```\nYou can specify a different tier size using the `--tier` parameter, if needed.\nYou can specify a different region using the `--region` parameter.\nIf the primary instance has an internal IP address only, and you want to   allow other Google Cloud services, such as BigQuery, to   access data in Cloud SQL and make queries against this data over   an internal connection, then add the `--enable-google-private-path` parameter to the command.\nYou must create the replica in the same VPC network as the primary instance. You can also specify an `allocated-ip-range-name` in that VPC network. If no range is specified, the replica is created in a random range.\nTo create a read replica, use a [Terraform resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/sql_database_instance) .\n [  cloud_sql/postgres_instance_replica/main.tf ](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-docs-samples/blob/main/cloud_sql/postgres_instance_replica/main.tf) [View on GitHub](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-docs-samples/blob/main/cloud_sql/postgres_instance_replica/main.tf) \n```\nresource \"google_sql_database_instance\" \"read_replica\" {\n name     = \"postgres-replica-instance-name\"\n master_instance_name = google_sql_database_instance.primary.name\n region    = \"europe-west4\"\n database_version  = \"POSTGRES_14\"\n settings {\n tier    = \"db-custom-2-7680\"\n availability_type = \"ZONAL\"\n disk_size   = \"100\"\n }\n # set `deletion_protection` to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by\n # use of Terraform whereas `deletion_protection_enabled` flag protects this instance at the GCP level.\n deletion_protection = false\n}\n```Use the [insert](/sql/docs/postgres/admin-api/rest/v1/instances/insert) method of the instances resource to create the read replica. The region  and databaseVersion properties must be the same as the master.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : The project ID\n- : Enum version string (for example, POSTGRES_12)\n- : The name of the primary instance\n- : The region of the primary instance\n- : The region of the replica instance\n- : The name of the replica instance\n- : Enum string of the machine type. For example: \"db-custom-1-3840\"\n- : The authorized network that you're adding or selecting to create a private connection.\nYou set the value of the`ipv4Enabled`parameter to`false`because you want the Cloud SQL instance to be associated with a private IP address, not a public IP one.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPOST https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/project-id/instances\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"masterInstanceName\": \"primary-instance-name\",\n \"project\": \"project-id\",\n \"databaseVersion\": \"database-version\",\n \"name\": \"replica-name\",\n \"region\": \"replica-region\",\n \"settings\":\n {\n \"tier\": \"machine-type\",\n \"settingsVersion\": 0,\n \"ipConfiguration\": {\n object (IpConfiguration)\n },\n {\n \"ipv4Enabled\": false,\n \"privateNetwork\": private-network,\n \"requireSsl\": boolean,\n \"authorizedNetworks\": [ {\n  object (AclEntry)\n }\n ],\n \"allocatedIpRange\": string\n }\n }\n}\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:Use the [insert](/sql/docs/postgres/admin-api/rest/v1beta4/instances/insert) method of the instances resource to create the read replica.

For more information on creating primary instances, see [Create a read replica](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/replication/create-replica#create-2nd-gen) .\n### Steps to create a cascading replica\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud SQL Instances** page. [Go to Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql) \n- Click the **Replicas** tab for the replica that will act as a parent for the replica that you want to create.\n- Click **Create replica** .\n- On the **Create read replica** page, update the instance ID, and any other configuration options, including the name,  region, and zone.\n- Click **Create** .Cloud SQL creates a replica. You're returned to the instance page for the  parent replica.\n- Follow steps 4-6 for each new cascading replica that you want to create.\n- Create the new replica by specifying your primary replica as the primary instance using the [--master-instance-name](/sql/docs/postgres/replication/sdk/gcloud/reference/sql/instances/create) flag:```\ngcloud sql instances create REPLICA_NAME \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 --master-instance-name=PARENT_REPLICA_NAME \\\n```Replace the following:- : the unique ID for the replica that you are creating\n- : the name of the parent replica- After the replica is created, you can see that the changes made to the primary instance are replicated through all the replicas in the cascading replicas chain.\n- To create a replica under the parent replica, edit the following JSON code sample and save it to a file called`request.json`:```\n{\u00a0 \"masterInstanceName\": \"PARENT_REPLICA_NAME\",\u00a0 \"project\": \"PROJECT_ID\",\u00a0 \"name\": \"REPLICA_NAME\",\u00a0 \"region\": \"REPLICA_REGION\",\u00a0 \"settings\":\u00a0 \u00a0 {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"tier\": \"MACHINE_TYPE\",\u00a0 \u00a0 }}\n```\n- Run the following command:```\ncurl -X POST-H \"Authorization: Bearer \"$(gcloud auth print-access-token)-H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\"-d @request.json\"https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/instances\"\n```## Troubleshoot\n| Issue             | Troubleshooting                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Read replica didn't start replicating on creation.  | There's probably a more specific error in the log files.

Replication lag takes place when the SQL thread on a replica is unable to keep up with the IO thread. Some kinds of queries or workloads can cause temporary or permanent high replication lag for a given schema. Some of the typical causes of replication lag are: Slow queries on the replica. Find and fix them. All tables must have a unique/primary key. Every update on such a table without a unique/primary key causes full table scans on th replica. Queries like DELETE ... WHERE field < 50000000 cause replication lag with row-based replication since a huge number of updates are piled up on the replica. Some possible solutions include: Edit the instance to increase the size of the replica. Reduce the load on the database. Send read traffic to the read replica. Index the tables. Identify and fix slow write queries. Recreate the replica. |\n| Errors when rebuilding indexes in PostgreSQL 9.6.  | You get an error from PostgreSQL informing you that you need to rebuild a particular index.
