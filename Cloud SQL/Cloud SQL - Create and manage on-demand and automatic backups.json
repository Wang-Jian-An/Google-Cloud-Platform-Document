The filename must have the`.tf`extension\u2014for example`main.tf`. In this  tutorial, the file is referred to as`main.tf`.```\nmkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf\n```\n- If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.Copy the sample code into the newly created `main.tf` .Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended  when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.\n- Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.\n- Save your changes.\n- Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.```\nterraform init\n```Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the `-upgrade` option:```\nterraform init -upgrade\n```\n## Apply the changes\n- Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or  update match your expectations:```\nterraform plan\n```Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.\n- Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering`yes`at the prompt:```\nterraform apply\n```Wait until Terraform displays the \"Apply complete!\" message.\n- [Open your Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to view  the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure  that Terraform has created or updated them.\n **Note:** Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project.To delete your changes, do the following:- To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the`deletion_protection`argument to`false`.```\ndeletion_protection = \"false\"\n```\n- Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and    entering`yes`at the prompt:```\nterraform apply\n```\n- Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering `yes` at the prompt:```\nterraform destroy\n```\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : the ID or [project number](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance\n- : the name of the primary or read replica instance that you're configuring for high availability\n- : the time (in hours and minutes)\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/instances/INSTANCE_NAME\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"settings\":\n {\n \"backupConfiguration\":\n {\n  \"startTime\": \"START_TIME\",\n  \"enabled\": true,\n  \"binaryLogEnabled\": true\n }\n }\n}\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:You can enable pointInTimeRecovery at the same time by setting `pointInTimeRecoveryEnabled` to `true` within the `backupConfiguration` object.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : the ID or [project number](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance\n- : the name of the primary or read replica instance that you're configuring for high availability\n- : the time (in hours and minutes)\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/PROJECT_ID/instances/INSTANCE_NAME\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"settings\":\n {\n \"backupConfiguration\":\n {\n  \"startTime\": \"START_TIME\",\n  \"enabled\": true,\n  \"pointInTimeRecoveryEnabled\": true\n }\n }\n}\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n**Note:** If an on-demand backup is ongoing when an automatic backup is scheduled to begin, the automatic backup is rescheduled for a later time.\n## Set a custom location for backups\nOnly use a custom backup location if required by regulation.
