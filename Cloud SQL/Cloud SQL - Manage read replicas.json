These operations include disabling and enabling replication, promoting a replica, configuring parallel replication, and checking the replication status.\nFor more information about how replication works, see [Replication in Cloud SQL](/sql/docs/postgres/replication) .\n", "content": "## Disable replication\nBy default, a replica starts with replication enabled. However, you can disable replication, for example, to debug or analyze the state of an instance. When you are ready, you explicitly re-enable replication. Disabling or re-enabling replication doesn't restart the replica instance.\nDisabling replication does not stop the replica instance; it becomes a read-only instance that is no longer replicating from its primary instance. You continue to be charged for the instance. On the disabled replica, you can re-enable replication, delete the replica, or promote the replica to a stand-alone instance.\nTo disable replication:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud SQL Instances** page. [Go to Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql) \n- Select a replica instance by clicking its name.\n- Click **Disable replication** in the button bar.\n- Click **OK** .\n```\ngcloud sql instances patch REPLICA_NAME \\--no-enable-database-replication\n```To execute this cURL command at a command line prompt, you acquire an access token by using the [gcloud auth print-access-token](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/print-access-token) command.

You can enable high availability after promoting the replica just as you would for any non-replica instance. Configuring a read replica for high availability is done the same way as for a primary instance. Learn more about [configuring the instance for high availability](/sql/docs/postgres/configure-ha#ha-existing) .\nSee [Promotingreplicas for regional migration or disaster recovery](/sql/docs/postgres/replication/cross-region-replicas) to learn more about use cases for cross-region replicas.\nBefore promoting a read replica, if the primary is still available and serving clients, you should do the following:\n- Stop all writes to the primary instance.\n- [Check the replication status](#replication-status) of the replica (follow the instructions in the **psql Client** tab).\n- Verify that the replica is replicating, and then wait until the replication lag reported by the`replay_lag`metric is 0.\nOtherwise, a newly promoted instance may be missing some transactions that were committed to the primary instance.\nTo promote a replica to a standalone instance:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud SQL Instances** page. [Go to Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql) \n- Select a replica instance by clicking its name.\n- Click **Promote replica** .\n- Click **Ok** .\n```\ngcloud sql instances promote-replica REPLICA_NAME\u00a0 \n```To execute this cURL command at a command line prompt, you acquire an access token by using the [gcloud auth print-access-token](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/print-access-token) command.

In particular, consider [configuring the instance for high availability](/sql/docs/configure-ha#ha-existing) if needed.\n## Check replication status\nWhen you view a replica instance using the Google Cloud console or log into the instance using an administration client, you get details about replication, including status and metrics. When you use the [gcloud CLI](/sdk/gcloud) , you get a brief summary of the replication configuration.\nBefore checking the replication status for a Cloud SQL replica instance, use the [gcloud sql instances describe](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/sql/instances/describe) command to display the status of the instance. As a result, you can see whether replication is enabled for the replica instance.\nThe following metrics are available for replica instances. ( [Learn more](/sql/docs/mysql/monitor-instance#available-metrics) about additional metrics available for all instances, including non-replica instances.)\n| Metric                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Replication\u00a0State (cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/replication/state)       | Indicates whether replication is actively streaming logs from the primary to the replica. Possible values are: Running Stopped Error This metric reports Running if: pg_catalog.pg_stat_wal_receiver reports a status of \"streaming\", and pg_catalog.pg_is_wal_replay_paused() reports \"f\" (false). For more information, see The Statistics Collector and System Administration Functions in the PostgreSQL Reference Manual.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Replication\u00a0Lag (cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/replication/replica_lag)      | The amount of time that the replica's state is lagging behind the state of the primary instance. This is the difference between (1) the current time and (2) the original timestamp at which the primary committed the transaction that is currently being applied on the replica. In particular, writes may be counted as lagging even if they have been received by the replica, if the replica has not yet applied the write to the database. For cascading replicas, each primary-replica pair is monitored separately and there's no single metric that yields the end-to-end (primary to replica) lag. For more information, see Replication lag.                                                                                           |\n| Lag\u00a0Bytes (cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/postgresql/replication/replica_byte_lag)   | Reports the number of bytes by which the read replica lags the primary.

These metrics are computed by comparing pg_catalog.pg_current_wal_lsn() to one of the following fields from pg_stat_replication: sent_lsn, write_lsn, flush_lsn, or replay_lsn. For more information, see The Statistics Collector in the PostgreSQL Reference Manual. |\n| Max\u00a0Lag\u00a0Bytes (cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/postgresql/external_sync/max_replica_byte_lag) | For a replica of an external primary, reports the maximum replication lag (in bytes) over all databases that are being replicated to this instance. For each database, this is defined as the number of bytes in the primary's write-ahead log that have not been confirmed to be received by the replica. This metric is computed by sending a query to the primary to compare pg_catalog.pg_current_wal_lsn() to the value of confirmed_flush_lsn for each database being replicated to this replica instance. For more information, see The Statistics Collector in the PostgreSQL Reference Manual.                                                                                                       |\nTo check replication status:\nCloud SQL reports the `Replication State` metric on the [default Cloud SQL monitoring dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/resourceList/cloudsql_database) .\nTo view other metrics for in-region and cross-region replicas, and  replicas of external servers, create a custom dashboard and add the metrics  you wish to monitor to it:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Monitoring** page. [Go to Monitoring](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring) \n- Select the **Dashboards** tab.\n- Click **Create dashboard** .\n- Give the dashboard a name and click OK.\n- Click **Add chart** .\n- For **Resource Type** select **Cloud SQL Database** .\n- Do any of the following:\n- **To monitor the replication state metric** : in the **Select a\n  metric** field, type`Replication state`. Then add a filter  for`state = \"Running\"`. The chart shows 1 if replication is  running and 0 otherwise.\n- **To monitor the replication lag, in bytes, for a read replica** : in  the **Select a metric** field, type`Lag Bytes`. Then add  a filter on`replica_lag_type = \"replay_location\"`. The chart  shows the number of bytes associated with transactions that have been  committed on the primary but have not yet been replayed on the  replica.\n- **To monitor the replication lag, in bytes, for a replica of an\n  external primary** : in the **Select a metric** field, type`Max Lag Bytes`. The chart shows the number of bytes  associated with transactions that have been committed on the primary but  have not yet been confirmed received by the replica.For a replica instance, check the replication status with:\n```\ngcloud sql instances describe REPLICA_NAME\n```\nIn the output, look for the properties `databaseReplicationEnabled` and `masterInstanceName` .\nFor a primary instance, check if there are replicas with:\n```\ngcloud sql instances describe PRIMARY_INSTANCE_NAME\n```\nIn the output, look for the property `replicaNames` .Some replication status metrics are produced by the primary and some  are produced by the replica. For the following steps, connect to the  replica or primary instance (as directed below) with a PostgreSQL  client.\nFor information, see [Connection options for external applications](/sql/docs/postgres/external-connection-methods) .- To check the replica's status **from the primary instance** :```\nselect * from pg_stat_replication;\n```Look for the following metrics in the output of the command:- `client_addr`: The IP address of the replica   instance.\n- `state`: Indicates whether the SQL thread for executing   events in the relay log is running. The value is`streaming`when replication is started.\n- `replay_lag`: The number of bytes that the replica SQL   thread is behind the primary instance. The value is`O`or   a small number of bytes.\n- To check the replica's status **from the replica instance** :```\nselect * from pg_stat_wal_receiver;\n```Look for the following metrics in the output of the command:- `sender_host`: The IP address of the primary   instance.\n- `status`: Indicates whether the SQL thread for executing   events in the relay log is running. The value is`streaming`when replication is started.\n- `last_msg_send_time`and`last_msg_receipt_time`: The difference between these two   timestamps is the lag time.\nTo check whether replication has been paused:```\nselect pg_is_wal_replay_paused();\n```The value is `t` if replication is paused and `f` otherwise.To check whether there are transactions that have been received from   the primary but not yet applied:```\n# for PostgreSQL 9.6select pg_catalog.pg_last_xlog_receive_location(), pg_catalog.pg_last_xlog_replay_location();# for PostgreSQL 10 and aboveselect pg_catalog.pg_last_wal_receive_lsn(), pg_catalog.pg_last_wal_replay_lsn();\n```If the two values are equal, then the replica has processed all of the   transactions it has received from the primary.\nFor more details about the output from these commands, see the  PostgreSQL documentation on [The  Statistics Collector](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/monitoring-stats.html) .\n## Troubleshoot\n| Issue             | Troubleshooting                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Read replica didn't start replicating on creation.  | There's probably a more specific error in the log files.

Replication lag takes place when the SQL thread on a replica is unable to keep up with the IO thread. Some kinds of queries or workloads can cause temporary or permanent high replication lag for a given schema. Some of the typical causes of replication lag are: Slow queries on the replica. Find and fix them. All tables must have a unique/primary key. Every update on such a table without a unique/primary key causes full table scans on th replica. Queries like DELETE ... WHERE field < 50000000 cause replication lag with row-based replication since a huge number of updates are piled up on the replica. Some possible solutions include: Edit the instance to increase the size of the replica. Reduce the load on the database. Send read traffic to the read replica. Index the tables.
