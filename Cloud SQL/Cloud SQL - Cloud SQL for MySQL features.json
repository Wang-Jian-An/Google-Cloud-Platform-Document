Private services access is supported. For more information, see [Private Access Optionsfor Services](/vpc/docs/private-access-options) .\n### User management in Cloud SQL for MySQL 8.0\nDue to changes in MySQL 8.0, you can't use `CREATE` or `DELETE` statements for MySQL user management. You also can't modify user privileges using `INSERT` , `UPDATE` , or `DELETE` statements. Instead, use `CREATE` , `DROP USER` , `GRANT` , and `REVOKE` statements to modify user privileges. For more information, see [Account managementnotes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-0.html#mysqld-8-0-0-account-management) .\n**Note:** Disregard information under Account management notes about running `mysql_upgrade` to upgrade to version 8.0. Instead, upgrade using the procedure in [Upgrading MySQL on aninstance](/sql/docs/mysql/upgrade-major-db-version-migrate) .\n## Differences between standard MySQL functionality and Cloud SQL for MySQL\nIn general, the MySQL functionality provided by a Cloud SQL instance is the same as the functionality provided by a locally-hosted MySQL instance. However, there are a few differences between a standard MySQL instance and a Cloud SQL instance.\n### Unsupported MySQL features for Cloud SQL\n- [Federated Engine](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/federated-storage-engine.html) \n- [Memory Storage Engine](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/memory-storage-engine.html) \nThe following feature is unsupported for Cloud SQL for MySQL 5.6 and 5.7:\n- [The SUPER privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super) **Note:** Because Cloud SQL is a managed service, it restricts access to certain system procedures and tables that require advanced privileges.\nThe following features are unsupported for Cloud SQL for MySQL 8.0:\n- [FIPS mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fips-mode.html) \n- [Resource groups](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/resource-groups.html) - [InnoDB memcached plugin](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-memcached.html) \n- [X plugin](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/x-plugin.html) \n- [Clone plugin](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/clone-plugin.html) \n- [InnoDB data-at-rest encryption](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-data-encryption.html) \n- [validate_password component](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/validate-password.html) The following SQL statements generate an error with the `Error 1290: The MySQL server is running with the Google option so it cannot execute this statement` message:\n- `LOAD DATA INFILE` **Note:** `LOAD DATA LOCAL` **INFILE** supported.\n- `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`\n- `SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE`\n- `INSTALL PLUGIN ...`\n- `UNINSTALL PLUGIN`\n- `CREATE FUNCTION ... SONAME ...`\nThe following statements aren't supported because MySQL instances use GTID replication:\n- `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT`statements\n- Transactions or statements that update both transactional and nontransactional tables\nThe following MySQL statement is unsupported for Cloud SQL for MySQL 5.6 and 5.7, but is supported for Cloud SQL for MySQL 8.0:\n- `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE`statements inside transactions\nFor more information, see the [MySQLdocumentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids-restrictions.html) .\n### Unsupported MySQL functions for Cloud SQL\n- `LOAD_FILE()`\n### Unsupported MySQL client program features for Cloud SQL\n- [mysqldump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html) using the `--tab` option or options that are used with `--tab` . This is because the [FILE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_file) privilege isn't granted for instance users. All other `mysqldump` options are supported. For information on using `mysqldump` options that optimize your file for importing into Cloud SQL, see [Export from your local MySQLserver usingmysqldump](/sql/docs/mysql/import-export/import-export-sql#export-mysqldump) .\n- [mysqlimport](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqlimport.html) without using the `--local` option. This is because of the `LOAD DATA INFILE` restriction. To import data into your Cloud SQL instance, see [importing using a dumpfile](/sql/docs/mysql/import-export/import-export-sql#import) or [importingusing a CSV file](/sql/docs/mysql/import-export/import-export-sql#import) .\n- If you want to import databases with binary data into your Cloud SQL instance, you must use the `--hex-blob` option with `mysqldump` .Although `hex-blob` isn't a required flag when you're using a local MySQL server instance and the `mysql` client, it's required if you want to import any databases with binary data into your Cloud SQL instance. To import data into your Cloud SQL instance, see [importing using a dumpfile](/sql/docs/mysql/import-export/import-export-sql#import) or [importingusing a CSV file](/sql/docs/mysql/import-export/import-export-sql#import) .\n- Not all MySQL options and parameters are enabled for editing as [Cloud SQL flags](/sql/docs/mysql/flags) .To request the addition of a configurable Cloud SQL flag, use the [Cloud SQL Discussiongroup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-cloud-sql-discuss) .\n- InnoDB is the only supported storage engine. For help with converting tables from MyISAM to InnoDB, see [Converting table toInnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/converting-tables-to-innodb.html) in the MySQL documentation.\n### MySQL options preset for Cloud SQL\nCloud SQL runs MySQL with a specific set of options. If an option might impact how your applications work, we note it here for your information.\n**skip-name-resolve**\nThis flag impacts how hostnames are resolved for client connections. See [skip-name-resolve](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_skip_name_resolve) in the MySQL documentation.\n**log_bin**\nThis flag reports whether binary logging is enabled. If the `--log-bin` option is used, then the value of this variable is `ON` ; otherwise it's `OFF` . See [log_bin](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#option_mysqld_log-bin) in the MySQL documentation.\n### MySQL 8.0 authentication for Cloud SQL\nCloud SQL for MySQL 8.0 uses `mysql_native_password` as the default authentication plugin for new users instead of `caching_sha2_password` . The `mysql_native_password` plugin is the default for MySQL 5.6 and 5.7 users.\nIf you want new users to use the [caching_sha2_password](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.html) plugin as the default authentication, you can configure your instance flag for `default_authentication_plugin` to use `caching_sha2_password` .\nTo configure existing users to use `caching_sha2_password` , use the `ALTER USER` command to change the authentication plugin.\nUsers that have `caching_sha2_password` authentication might need to use the [get-server-public-key](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connection-options.html#option_general_get-server-public-key) flag when connecting. For details, see [Using SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sha256-pluggable-authentication.html#sha256-pluggable-authentication-usage) in the MySQL documentation.\n### Changes to MySQL system flags in Cloud SQL\nFor some MySQL system flags, Cloud SQL uses values that differ from the default values. You can't change the values for these flags. For a list of flags, see [MySQL system flags changed inCloud SQL](/sql/docs/mysql/flags#mysql_system_flags_changed_in) .\n### Unsupported Cloud SQL features in Cloud SQL for MySQL 8.0\nCloud SQL for MySQL 8.0 doesn't support the legacy version of MySQL high availability (HA) configuration that uses failover replicas. It supports the new regional [HA configuration](/sql/docs/mysql/high-availability) .", "guide": "Cloud SQL"}
