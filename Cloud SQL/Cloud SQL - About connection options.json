{"title": "Cloud SQL - About connection options", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-overview", "abstract": "# Cloud SQL - About connection options\nThis page provides an overview of the ways in which you can connect to your Cloud SQL instance and describes the available authentication and authorization options.\n", "content": "## Overview\nWhen considering how to connect to your Cloud SQL instance, there are many choices to keep in mind, including:\n- Do you want your Cloud SQL instance to be accessible from the  internet, or kept private within a Virtual Private Cloud  (VPC) network, or make it both publicly and privately  accessible?\n- Are you planning to write your own connection code, or connect using  publicly available tools such as the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or a [psql client](/sql/docs/postgres/connect-admin-ip) ?\n- Do you want to require encryption through SSL/TLS or allow unencrypted  traffic?\nIn the following sections, we discuss the options Cloud SQL provides for connecting, authorizing, and authenticating to your database.\n- **How to connect** - which network path you use to reach your instance:- An internal, VPC-only () IP address.\n- An external, internet-accessible () IP address.\n- **How to authorize** - which connections areand allowed to connect to your Cloud SQL instance:- Cloud SQL Auth Proxy and Cloud SQL connector libraries for Java and Python - these provide access based on IAM.\n- Self-managed SSL/TLS certificates - these only allow connections based on specific public keys.\n- Authorized networks - a list of IP addresses allowed to connect.\n- **How to authenticate** - the method to login to your database.- Built-in database authentication - log in with a username/password set in the database engine.\n- IAM database authentication - log in with an email or with an OAuth 2.0 token as a password.Use the information that follows to decide which connection, authorization, and authentication options work best for you.\nYou can create an account to evaluate how Cloud SQL performs in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to spend on Cloud SQL to run, test, and deploy workloads. You won't be charged until you upgrade.Sign up to [ try Cloud SQL for free](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?redirectPath=/sql) .\n## Before you start\nGranting access to an application does not automatically enable a database user account to connect to the instance. Before you can connect to an instance, you must have a database user account you can connect with. For new instances, this means you must have configured the default user account. For more information, see [Manage users with built-in authentication](/sql/docs/postgres/create-manage-users) .\n## How to connect to Cloud SQL\nDatabase connections consume resources on the server and the connecting application. Always use good connection management practices to minimize your application's footprint and reduce the likelihood of exceeding Cloud SQL [connection limits](/sql/docs/postgres/quotas#configurable-limits) . For more information, see [Managing database connections](/sql/docs/postgres/manage-connections) .\n### Public and private IP\nIn Cloud SQL, public IP means that the instance is accessible through the public internet. In contrast, instances using only private IP are not accessible through the public internet, but are accessible through a [Virtual Private Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/overview) (VPC). Cloud SQL instances can have both a public and a private IP address.\n### Private IP\nA private IP is an IPv4 address that's accessible on a [Virtual Private Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/overview) (VPC).\nYou can use this address to connect from other resources with access to the VPC. Connections over private IP typically provide lower latency and limited attack vectors because they don't require traversing the internet. Optionally, you can require that all connections use either the [Cloud SQL proxy](#cloud_sql_proxy) or [self-managed SSL certificates](#ssl_tls) .\nConfiguring your instance with a private IP is preferred when connecting from a client on a resource with access to a VPC. For more information about what resources can use private IP, see [Requirements for Private IP](/sql/docs/postgres/private-ip#requirements_for_private_ip) .\nFor private IP paths, the following services and applications connect directly to your instance through [Serverless VPC Access](/vpc/docs/configure-serverless-vpc-access) :\n- App Engine standard environment\n- App Engine flexible environment\n- Cloud Functions\n- Cloud Run\nLearn more about [using private IPwith Cloud SQL](/sql/docs/postgres/private-ip)\nFor instructions on adding a private IP to your instance, see one of the following:\n- [Configuring Private IP Connectivity](/sql/docs/postgres/configure-private-ip) .\n- [Connect to an instance using Private Service Connect ](/sql/docs/postgres/configure-private-service-connect) \n### Public IP\nA public IP is an IPv4 address that's available externally on the public internet. This address can receive connections from devices both inside and outside of Google's network, including from locations like your home or office.\nTo help keep your instance secure, any connections to a Cloud SQL instance using a public IP must be authorized using either the [Cloud SQL Auth Proxy](#cloud_sql_proxy) or [authorized networks](/sql/docs/postgres/authorize-networks) .\nConfiguring your instance with a public IP is best when connecting from a client that doesn't meet the requirements for a VPC.\nFor instructions about adding a public IP to your instance, see [Configuring Public IP Connectivity](/sql/docs/postgres/configure-ip) .\nFor information about connecting a psql client to a Cloud SQL instance using public IP, see [Connecting using a database client](/sql/docs/postgres/connect-admin-ip) .\n### Dynamically assigned IP addresses\nSome applications need to connect to your Cloud SQL instance using a dynamically assigned, or ephemeral, IP address. This is the case for Platform as a Service (PaaS) applications, among others.\nIn these cases, you must use the [Cloud SQL Auth Proxy](/sql/docs/postgres/sql-proxy) .\n## How to authorize to Cloud SQL\n**Note:** These options only let you control which connections are allowed to connect to your instance. You must still provide a database username and password to [authenticate with the database engine](#authenticate) .\n### Cloud SQL Language Connectors\nCloud SQL Language Connectors are client libraries that provide encryption and [IAM](/iam) authorization when connecting to a Cloud SQL instance. Cloud SQL recommends using the Cloud SQL Language Connectors to connect to your Cloud SQL instance over other connection options.\nYou can use these libraries directly from their supported programming language. They provide the same authentication as the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy without requiring an external process. This provides improved security and reduced configuration requirements to connect to Cloud SQL. Cloud SQL Language Connectors also use the same code when connecting using a public IP address or a private IP address.\nTo get started, see [About the Cloud SQL Language Connectors](/sql/docs/postgres/language-connectors) .\n### Cloud SQL Auth Proxy\nThe Cloud SQL Auth Proxy lets you authorize and secure your connections by using [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/iam/docs/overview) permissions. The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy validates connections using credentials for a user or service account and wrapping the connection in a SSL/TLS layer that's authorized for a Cloud SQL instance. For more details about how the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy works, see [About the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy](/sql/docs/postgres/sql-proxy) .\nUsing the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is the recommended method for authenticating connections to a Cloud SQL instance because it's the most secure method.\nThe Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is an [open source library](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudsql-proxy) distributed as an executable binary. The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy acts as an intermediary server that listens for incoming connections, wraps them in SSL/TLS, and then passes them to a Cloud SQL instance.\nSome environments provide a mechanism that connects using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy. For instructions about connecting using these environments, see one of the following:\n- [Connecting from Cloud Run](/sql/docs/postgres/connect-run) \n- [Connecting from Cloud Functions](/sql/docs/postgres/connect-functions) \n- [Connecting from the App Engine standard environment](/sql/docs/postgres/connect-app-engine-standard) \n- [Connecting from the App Engine flexible environment](/sql/docs/postgres/connect-app-engine-flexible) \n- [Connecting from Google Kubernetes Engine](/sql/docs/postgres/connect-kubernetes-engine) \n### Self-managed SSL/TLS certificates\nInstead of using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to encrypt your connections, it's possible to set up client/server SSL/TLS certificates that are specific to a Cloud SQL instance. These certificates are used to both validate the client and server to each other and encrypt connections between them.\nIt's strongly recommended to use self-managed SSL/TLS certificates to provide encryption when not using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy. Failing to do so means your data is being transmitted insecurely and might be intercepted or inspected by a third party.\nTo get started with self-managed SSL/TLS certificates, see [Authorizing with SSL/TLS certificates](/sql/docs/postgres/authorize-ssl) .\n### Authorized networks\n**Note:** It's strongly encouraged to always use self-managed SSL/TLS certificates when using authorized networks to authenticate connections. Unless encrypted, your traffic might be vulnerable to interception by third parties.\nUnless using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, connections to the public IP address of an instance are allowed only if the connection comes from an . Authorized networks are IP addresses or ranges that the user has specified as having permission to connect.\n**Warning:** Use caution when adding authorized networks. Because all devices on a network often share the same external IP address, authorizing a single address might authorize all devices on the same network instead of a single client.\nTo get started with authorized networks, see [Authorizing with Authorized Networks](/sql/docs/postgres/authorize-networks) .\n## How to authenticate to Cloud SQL\nAuthentication provides access control by verifying the identity of a user. For end users, authentication is achieved when the user enters credentials (a username and password). For applications, authentication is achieved when a user's credentials are assigned to a service account.\nCloud SQL uses the database's built-in authentication that authenticates using a username and password.
