When you type the name, the form suggests a project ID, which you can edit. The project ID must be between 6 and 30 characters, with a lowercase letter as the first character. You can use a dash, lowercase letter, or digit for the remaining characters, but the last character cannot be a dash.- Enable the Cloud APIs necessary to run a Cloud SQL sample app on a Compute Engine VM instance.\nClick the **Enable APIs** button to enable the API required for this quickstart.\n [Enable APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=sqladmin.googleapis.com) \nThis enables the following API:- Cloud SQL Admin API\n [Install the ](/sdk/docs/install)  [gcloud CLI](/sdk/gcloud) which provides   command-line access to your Google Cloud resources. The [gcloud CLI](/sdk/gcloud) is used   to run the `gcloud CLI` commands presented throughout this quickstart.   All the commands are formatted to be run in a terminal or a Powershell window.\nRun the following `gcloud` command:\n```\ngcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com\n```\nThis command enables the following API:- Cloud SQL Admin API\n## Set up Cloud SQL\n### Create a Cloud SQL instance### Create a database- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud SQL Instances** page. [Go to Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql) \n- Select`quickstart-instance`.\n- Open the **Databases** tab.\n- Click **Create database** .\n- In the **Create a database** dialog box, enter`quickstart_db`as the name of the database, and optionally the character set and collation.\n- Click **Create** .Run the [gcloud sql databases create](/sdk/gcloud/reference/sql/databases/create) command to create a database.\n```\ngcloud sql databases create quickstart_db --instance=quickstart-instance\n```\n### Create a user- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud SQL Instances** page. [Go to Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql) \n- To open the **Overview** page of an instance, click the instance name.\n- Select **Users** from the SQL navigation menu.\n- Click **Add user account** .\n- In the **Add a user account to instance instance_name** page,   add the following information:- **Username** : Set to`quickstart-user`\n- **Password** : Specify a password for your database user.    Make a note of this for use in a later step of this quickstart.\n- In the **Host name** section, the default is **Allow any host** ,   which means that the user can connect from any IP address.Optionally, select **Restrict host by IP address or address range** and enter an IP address or address range in the **Host** section.   The user can then connect only from the IP address or   addresses specified.\n- Click **Add** .\nBefore running the following command, make the following replacements:- with a password for your database user.    Make a note of this for use in a later step of this quickstart.\nRun the [gcloud sql users create](/sdk/gcloud/reference/sql/users/create) command to create the user.\n```\ngcloud sql users create quickstart-user --instance=quickstart-instance --password=PASSWORD\n```\nUser name length limits are the same for Cloud SQL as for on-premises MySQL; 32 characters for MySQL 8.0, 16 characters for earlier versions.\n### Configure a Compute Engine service account\nCreate and configure a Google Cloud service account that has the **Cloud SQL Client** role with permissions to connect to Cloud SQL. After you create a service account, you might need to wait for 60 seconds or more before you use the service account.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Create service account** page.\n- [Go to Create service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create) \n- Select a Google Cloud project.\n- Enter a`quickstart-service-account`as the service account name.\n- Optional: Enter a description of the service account.\n- Click **Create and continue** and continue to   the next step.\n- Choose the **Cloud SQL Client** role   to grant to the service account on the project.\n- Click **Add another role** and choose the **Storage Object Viewer** role   to grant to the service account on the project.\n- Click **Continue** .\n- Click **Done** to finish creating the service account.\n- To create the service account, run the [gcloud iam service-accounts create](/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/service-accounts/create) command:\n- ```\ngcloud iam service-accounts create quickstart-service-account --description=\"DESCRIPTION\" --display-name=\"quickstart-service-account\"\n```\n- Replace the following value:\n- : an optional description of the    service account\n- To grant your service account the **Cloud SQL Client** role    and the **Storage Object Viewer** role on your project, run the [gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding](/sdk/gcloud/reference/projects/add-iam-policy-binding) command. Replacewith your Google Cloud project ID:```\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member=\"serviceAccount:quickstart-service-account@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com\" --role=\"roles/cloudsql.client\" --role=\"roles/storage.objectViewer\"\n```\n## Create Compute Engine VM instance\nCreate a Compute Engine VM Instance to host a sample web app that connects to Cloud SQL.\n## Access Compute Engine VM instance## Setup development environment for programming language\nSet up the Compute Engine VM instance's development environment for your preferred programming language.\n## Install Git\nInstall [Git](https://git-scm.com/) , an open source version control system on to your Compute Engine VM instance.\n## Clone sample appClone a sample app to your Compute Engine VM instance using the [git clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) command.\nOn your Compute Engine VM instance, open a new terminal or Powershell   window.
