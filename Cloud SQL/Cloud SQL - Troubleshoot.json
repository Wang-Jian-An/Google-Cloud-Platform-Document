However, if the instance is restored, then its backups are also restored. For more information on recovering a deleted instance, see Recovery backups. If you have done an export operation, create a new instance and then do an import operation to recreate the database. Exports are written to Cloud Storage and imports are read from there.                                                                       |\n| An automated backup is stuck for many hours and can't be canceled.                           | Backups can take a long time depending on the database size.

If they don't, the restore operation fails to recreate the objects with the original ownership or permissions. Create the database users before restoring the SQL dump.                                                                                        |\n| You want to increase the number of days that you can keep automatic backups from seven to 30 days, or longer.                | You can configure the number of automated backups to retain, from 1 to 365. Automated backups get pruned regularly based on the retention value configured. Unfortunately, this means that the currently visible backups are the only automated backups you can restore from. To keep backups indefinitely, you can create an on-demand backup, as they are not deleted in the same way as automated backups. On-demand backups remain indefinitely. That is, they remain until they're deleted or the instance they belong to is deleted. Because that type of backup is not deleted automatically, it can affect billing.                   |\n| An automated backup failed and you didn't receive an email notification.                          | To have Cloud SQL notify you of the backup's status, configure a log-based alert.                                                                                                                                                        |\n| An instance is repeatedly failing because it is cycling between the failure and backup restore states. Attempts to connect to and use the database following restore fail. | There could be too many open connections. Too many connections can result from errors that occur in the middle of a connection where there are no autovacuum settings to clean up dead connections. Cycling can occur if any custom code is using retry logic that doesn't stop after a few failures. There could be too much traffic. Use connection pooling and other best practices for connectivity. Things to try: Verify that the database is set up for autovacuum. Check if there is any connection retry logic set up in custom code. Turn down traffic until the database recovers and then slowly turn traffic back up.                  |\n| You find you are missing data when performing a backup/restore operation.                         | Tables were created as unlogged. For example: CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE .... These tables are not included in a restore from a backup: The contents of unlogged tables doesn't survive failover on an HA instance. Unlogged tables don't survive postgres crashes. Unlogged tables are not replicated to read replicas. Unlogged tables are automatically wiped during backup restore. The solution is to avoid using unlogged tables if you want to restore those tables through a backup. If you're restoring from a database that already has unlogged tables, then you can dump the database to a file, and reload the data after modifying the dumped file to ALTER TABLE to SET LOGGED on those tables. |\n## Cancel import and export\n| Issue                                   | Troubleshooting                                   |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Error message: You can't cancel operation [operation-ID] because this operation isn't in progress.            | You're trying to cancel an import or export operation that's completed, failed, or cancelled.

No response to TCP keep-alive commands (either the client or the server isn't responsive, possibly overloaded) The database engine connection lifetime was exceeded and the server ends the connection. Applications must tolerate network failures and follow best practices such as connection pooling and retrying. Most connection poolers catch these errors where possible. Otherwise the application must either retry or fail gracefully. For connection retry, we recommend the following methods: Exponential backoff. Increase the time interval between each retry, exponentially. Add randomized backoff also. Combining these methods helps reduce throttling. |\n| Certificate verify failed.    | The client certificates have expired or the path to the certificates isn't correct.

Couldn't find free blocks in allocated IP ranges. Please allocate new ranges for this service provider. | There are no more available addresses in the allocated IP range. There can be several possible scenarios: The size of the allocated IP range for the private service connection is smaller than /24. The size of the allocated IP range for the private service connection is too small for the number of Cloud SQL instances. The requirement on the size of allocated IP range will be larger if instances are created in multiple regions. See allocated range size To resolve this issue, you can either expand the existing allocated IP range or allocate an additional IP range to the private service connection. For more information, see Allocate an IP address range. If you used the --allocated-ip-range-name flag while creating the Cloud SQL instance, you may only expand the specified IP range. If you're allocating a new range, take care that the allocation doesn't overlap with any existing allocations. After creating a new IP range, update the vpc peering with the following command: gcloud services vpc-peerings update \\ --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \\ --ranges=OLD_RESERVED_RANGE_NAME,NEW_RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \\ --network=VPC_NETWORK \\ --project=PROJECT_ID \\ --force If you're expanding an existing allocation, take care to increase only the allocation range and not decrease it. For example, if the original allocation was 10.0.10.0/24, then make the new allocation at least 10.0.10.0/23. In general, if starting from a /24 allocation, decrementing the /mask by 1 for each condition (additional instance type group, additional region) is a good rule of thumb. For example, if trying to create both instance type groups on the same allocation, going from /24 to /23 is enough. After expanding an existing IP range, update the vpc peering with following command: gcloud services vpc-peerings update \\ --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \\ --ranges=RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \\ --network=VPC_NETWORK \\ --project=PROJECT_ID |\n| Error message: Failed to create subnetwork.

Export offloading has several advantages, including increased performance on the source instance and the unblocking of administrative operations while the export is running. With export offloading, total latency can increase by the amount of time it takes to bring up the offload instance. Generally, for reasonably sized exports, latency is not significant. However, if your export is small enough, then you may notice the increase in latency. |\n| Create Extension error.                                 | The dump file contains references to unsupported extension.

Refer to general performance tips in particular. For slow database inserts, updates, or deletes, consider the following actions: Check the locations of the writer and database; sending data a long distance introduces latency. Check the location of the reader and database; latency affects read performance even more than write performance To reduce the latency the recommendation is to locate both the source and destination resources in the same region.                               |\n| Out of memory is indicated but monitoring charts don't show that. | An instance can fail and report Out of memory but the Google Cloud console or Cloud Monitoring charts seem to show there's still memory remaining.

You can export data from your instance into a Cloud Storage bucket, create a new instance with the new name you want, and then import the data into the new instance. In both cases, you can delete your old instance after the operation is done.

Replication lag takes place when the SQL thread on a replica is unable to keep up with the IO thread. Some kinds of queries or workloads can cause temporary or permanent high replication lag for a given schema. Some of the typical causes of replication lag are: Slow queries on the replica. Find and fix them. All tables must have a unique/primary key. Every update on such a table without a unique/primary key causes full table scans on th replica. Queries like DELETE ... WHERE field < 50000000 cause replication lag with row-based replication since a huge number of updates are piled up on the replica. Some possible solutions include: Edit the instance to increase the size of the replica. Reduce the load on the database. Send read traffic to the read replica. Index the tables. Identify and fix slow write queries. Recreate the replica. |\n| Errors when rebuilding indexes in PostgreSQL 9.6.  | You get an error from PostgreSQL informing you that you need to rebuild a particular index. This can be done only on the primary instance. If you create a new replica instance, you soon get the same error again. Hash indexes are not propagated to replicas in PostgreSQL versions below 10. If you must use hash indexes, upgrade to PostgreSQL 10+. Otherwise, if you also want to use replicas, don't use hash indexes in PostgreSQL 9.6.                                                                                                                      |\n| Query on the primary instance is always running.  | After creating a replica, the query SELECT * from pg_stat_activity where state = 'active' and pid = XXXX and username = 'cloudsqlreplica' is expected to run continuously on your primary instance.                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Replica creation fails with timeout.     | Long-running uncommitted transactions on the primary instance can cause read replica creation to fail.
