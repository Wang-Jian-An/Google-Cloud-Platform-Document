{"title": "Cloud SQL - Delete instances", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/delete-instance", "abstract": "# Cloud SQL - Delete instances\nThis page describes how to delete Cloud SQL instances.\n**Warning:** All data on an instance, including backups, is permanently lost when that instance is deleted. To preserve your data, [export it to Cloud Storage](/sql/docs/postgres/import-export) before you delete it. The Cloud SQL Admin role includes the permission to delete the instance. To prevent accidental deletion, grant this role only as needed. Additionally, consider [deletion protection](/sql/docs/postgres/deletion-protection) .\nNote the following when you plan to delete an instance:\n- You cannot delete an instance that has any replicas. You must delete all replicas first.You can reduce your chances of accidentally deleting an instance by creating a replica; a replica must be deleted before its primary instance.\n- After you delete an instance, it might continue to appear in your project with an \"unknown\" size but with a \"Being deleted\" status. This is normal and the instance disappears completely after a brief period of time.\n- It can take up to a week for the underlying resources related to an instance to be completely deleted, with the exception of read replicas, which are often deleted within a few minutes.\n- The deleted instance name can be reused immediately to create a new instance.\n- If [deletion protection](/sql/docs/postgres/deletion-protection) is enabled on an instance, you must disable it before deleting the instance.", "content": "## Required permissions\nBy default, only user or service accounts with the `Cloud SQL Admin` ( `roles/cloudsql.admin` ) or `Owner` ( `roles/owner` ) role have the permission to delete a Cloud SQL instance ( `cloudsql.instances.delete` ).\nYou can also define an [IAM custom role](/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles) for the user or service account that includes the `cloudsql.instances.delete` permission. This permission is [supported](/iam/docs/custom-roles-permissions-support) in IAM custom roles.\n## Delete an instance\nYou can delete a Cloud SQL instance by using [](/sdk/gcloud)  [gcloud CLI](/sdk/gcloud) or the API.\n**Note: ** Before you delete an instance, confirm that it's safe to do so. Then, confirm that [deletion protection](/sql/docs/postgres/deletion-protection) is deactivated for the instance.If you delete an instance that has [Private Service Connect](/sql/docs/postgres/about-private-service-connect) enabled for it, then the following actions occur:- The [service attachment](/sql/docs/postgres/about-private-service-connect#service-attachment) is removed automatically. However, the [Private Service Connect endpoint](/sql/docs/postgres/about-private-service-connect#psc-endpoint) that points to the service attachment isn't deleted automatically. By listing the forwarding rule that's associated with the endpoint, you can see that the rule has a`CLOSED`status. After you receive this status, you can delete the endpoint.\n- You see the connection to the endpoint time out.\nTo avoid incurring additional costs, we strongly recommend that you also delete the corresponding [DNS zone](/dns/docs/dns-overview#zones) and [DNS record](/dns/docs/dns-overview#records) .\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud SQL Instances** page. [Go to Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql) \n- To open the **Overview** page of an instance, click the instance name.\n- Click **Delete** .\n- In the **Delete database instance** dialog, click **OK** .\nTo delete an instance, use the [gcloud sql instances delete](/sdk/gcloud/reference/sql/instances/delete) command:\n```\ngcloud sql instances delete INSTANCE_NAME \\--project=PROJECT_ID\n```\nMake the following replacements:- : the name of the instance\n- : the ID or [project number](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance that you want to delete\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : the ID or [project number](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance that you want to delete\n- : the name of the instance\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nDELETE https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/instances/INSTANCE_NAME\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"kind\": \"sql#operation\",\n \"targetLink\": \"https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/instances/INSTANCE_NAME\",\n \"status\": \"PENDING\",\n \"user\": \"user@example.com\",\n \"insertTime\": \"2020-01-15T00:10:22.078Z\",\n \"operationType\": \"DELETE\",\n \"name\": \"OPERATION_ID\",\n \"targetId\": \"INSTANCE_NAME\",\n \"selfLink\": \"https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/operations/OPERATION_ID\",\n \"targetProject\": \"PROJECT_ID\"\n}\n```\nTo see how the\n [underlying REST API request](/sql/docs/postgres/admin-api/rest/v1beta4/instances/delete) \nis constructed for this task, see the\n [APIs Explorer on the instances:delete page](/sql/docs/postgres/admin-api/rest/v1beta4/instances/delete) \n.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : the ID or [project number](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance that you want to delete\n- : the name of the instance\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nDELETE https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/PROJECT_ID/instances/INSTANCE_NAME\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"kind\": \"sql#operation\",\n \"targetLink\": \"https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/PROJECT_ID/instances/INSTANCE_NAME\",\n \"status\": \"PENDING\",\n \"user\": \"user@example.com\",\n \"insertTime\": \"2020-01-15T00:10:22.078Z\",\n \"operationType\": \"DELETE\",\n \"name\": \"OPERATION_ID\",\n \"targetId\": \"INSTANCE_NAME\",\n \"selfLink\": \"https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/PROJECT_ID/operations/OPERATION_ID\",\n \"targetProject\": \"PROJECT_ID\"\n}\n```\nTo see how the\n [underlying REST API request](/sql/docs/postgres/admin-api/rest/v1beta4/instances/delete) \nis constructed for this task, see the\n [APIs Explorer on the instances:delete page](/sql/docs/postgres/admin-api/rest/v1beta4/instances/delete) \n.", "guide": "Cloud SQL"}
