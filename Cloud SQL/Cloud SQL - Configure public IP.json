{"title": "Cloud SQL - Configure public IP", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/configure-ip", "abstract": "# Cloud SQL - Configure public IP\nThis page describes how to configure public IP connectivity for a Cloud SQL instance.\n", "content": "## Introduction\nYou can configure your Cloud SQL instance to have a public IPv4 address, and to accept connections from specific IP addresses or a range of addresses by adding authorized addresses to your instance.\nYou can't specify a private network (for example, 10.x.x.x) as an authorized network.\nPublic IP addresses for PostgreSQL instances:\n- IPv6: Instances do not support IPv6.\n- IPv4: Instances have a static IPv4 address automatically assigned. There is a small charge for the IP address any time your instance is off (deactivated).\nFor help with connecting an administration client to your instance over an IP connection, see [Connecting psql Clientusing IP addresses](/sql/docs/postgres/connect-admin-ip) .\nIf you configure your instance to accept connections using its public IP address, also configure it to use SSL to keep your data secure. For more information, see [Configure SSL for Instances](/sql/docs/postgres/configure-ssl-instance) .\nTo configure your instance with an IP address that is not exposed to the public internet, see [Configuring Private IP Connectivity](/sql/docs/postgres/configure-private-ip) .\n## Enable public IP and add an authorized address or address range\nWhen you enable public IP for your instance, Cloud SQL configures the instance with a public, static IPv4 address. After you enable public IP, you must set up authorization for database connections. See the [Authorization options](/sql/docs/postgres/connect-overview#authentication_options) for more information.\nTo enable public IP and add an authorized address:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud SQL Instances** page. [Go to Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql) \n- To open the **Overview** page of an instance, click the instance name.\n- From the SQL navigation menu, select **Connections** .\n- Click the **Networking** tab.\n- Select the **Public IP** checkbox.\n- Click **Add network** .\n- Optionally, in the **Name** field, enter a name for this network.\n- In the **Network** field, enter the IP address or address range from which you want to allow connections.Use [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation) .\n- Click **Done** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- If you haven't already, add an IPv4 address to the instance:```\ngcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME\\--assign-ip\n```\n- Show all existing authorized addresses by describing the instance:```\ngcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME\n```Look for **authorizedNetwork** entries under **ipConfiguration** , and note any authorized addresses you want to keep.\n- Update the authorized network list, including all addresses you want included.```\ngcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME \\--authorized-networks=IP_ADDR1,IP_ADDR2...\n```Use [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation) .\n- Confirm your changes:```\ngcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME\n```\nWhen you remove an authorized address, existing connections from that address aredisconnected. If you want to disconnect existing connections, restart your instance.\nTo remove all authorized networks, use the following command:```\n\u00a0 gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --clear-authorized-networks\u00a0 \n```\n- Show all existing authorized addresses by describing the instance:Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : The project ID\n- : The instance ID\n- The instance machine type\n- The instance zone\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/project-id/instances/instance-id?fields=settings\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n- Update the instance, includingaddresses you want set on the instance:Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : The project ID\n- : The instance ID\n- An authorized ip address or range\n- Another authorized ip address or range\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/project-id/instances/instance-id\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"settings\":\n {\n \"ipConfiguration\":\n {\n  \"authorizedNetworks\":\n  [{\"value\": \"network_range_1\"}, {\"value\": \"network_range_2\"}]\n }\n }\n}\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:Use [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation) .\n- Confirm your changes:Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : The project ID\n- : The instance ID\n- : The CIDR form of the first IP address\n- : The name of the first IP address\n- : The CIDR form of the second IP address\n- : The name of the second IP address\n- The instance machine type\n- The instance zone\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/project-id/instances/instance-id?fields=settings\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\nWhen you remove an authorized address, existing connections from that address aredisconnected. If you want to disconnect existing connections, restart your instance.\nTo remove all authorized networks, use the following command:```\n\u00a0 gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --clear-authorized-networks\u00a0 \n```To enable public IP and add an authorized address or address range, use a [Terraform resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/sql_database_instance) .\n [  cloud_sql/postgres_instance_public_ip/main.tf ](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-docs-samples/blob/main/cloud_sql/postgres_instance_public_ip/main.tf) [View on GitHub](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-docs-samples/blob/main/cloud_sql/postgres_instance_public_ip/main.tf) \n```\nresource \"google_sql_database_instance\" \"postgres_public_ip_instance_name\" {\n database_version = \"POSTGRES_14\"\n name    = \"postgres-public-ip-instance-name\"\n region   = \"asia-southeast2\"\n settings {\n availability_type = \"ZONAL\"\n ip_configuration {\n  # Add optional authorized networks\n  # Update to match the customer's networks\n  authorized_networks {\n  name = \"test-net-3\"\n  value = \"203.0.113.0/24\"\n  }\n  # Enable public IP\n  ipv4_enabled = true\n }\n tier = \"db-custom-2-7680\"\n }\n # set `deletion_protection` to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by\n # use of Terraform whereas `deletion_protection_enabled` flag protects this instance at the GCP level.\n deletion_protection = false\n}\n```To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.## Prepare Cloud Shell\n- Launch [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) .\n- Set the default Google Cloud project  where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.```\nexport GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=PROJECT_ID\n```Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform  configuration file.\n## Prepare the directoryEach Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also called a ).- In [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) , create a directory and a new  file within that directory. The filename must have the`.tf`extension\u2014for example`main.tf`. In this  tutorial, the file is referred to as`main.tf`.```\nmkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf\n```\n- If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.Copy the sample code into the newly created `main.tf` .Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended  when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.\n- Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.\n- Save your changes.\n- Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.```\nterraform init\n```Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the `-upgrade` option:```\nterraform init -upgrade\n```\n## Apply the changes\n- Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or  update match your expectations:```\nterraform plan\n```Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.\n- Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering`yes`at the prompt:```\nterraform apply\n```Wait until Terraform displays the \"Apply complete!\" message.\n- [Open your Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to view  the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure  that Terraform has created or updated them.\n **Note:** Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project.To delete your changes, do the following:- To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the`deletion_protection`argument to`false`.```\ndeletion_protection = \"false\"\n```\n- Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and    entering`yes`at the prompt:```\nterraform apply\n```\n- Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering `yes` at the prompt:```\nterraform destroy\n```\n- Show all existing authorized addresses by describing the instance:Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : The project ID\n- : The instance ID\n- The instance machine type\n- The instance zone\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/project-id/instances/instance-id?fields=settings\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n- Update the instance, includingaddresses you want set on the instance:Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : The project ID\n- : The instance ID\n- An authorized ip address or range\n- Another authorized ip address or range\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/project-id/instances/instance-id\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"settings\":\n {\n \"ipConfiguration\":\n {\n  \"authorizedNetworks\":\n  [{\"value\": \"network_range_1\"}, {\"value\": \"network_range_2\"}]\n }\n }\n}\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:Use [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation) .\n- Confirm your changes:Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : The project ID\n- : The instance ID\n- : The CIDR form of the first IP address\n- : The name of the first IP address\n- : The CIDR form of the second IP address\n- : The name of the second IP address\n- The instance machine type\n- The instance zone\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/project-id/instances/instance-id?fields=settings\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\nWhen you remove an authorized address, existing connections from that address aredisconnected.
