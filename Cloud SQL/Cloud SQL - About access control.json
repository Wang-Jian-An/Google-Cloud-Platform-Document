You must configure both levels of access control before you can manage your instance.\n", "content": "## Levels of access control\nConfiguring access control involves controlling who or what can access the instance. Access control occurs on two levels:\n**Note:** For information about controlling who can your instance, see [Project access control](/sql/docs/project-access-control) .### Instance-level access\n| Connection source    | Access configuration options                   | More information         |\n|:--------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| Compute Engine     | Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Authorize static IP address              | Connecting from Compute Engine     |\n| Google Kubernetes Engine  | Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Docker image Private IP If using Public IP, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is required | Connecting from Google Kubernetes Engine   |\n| App Engine standard environment | Same project: configure IAM Between projects: configure IAM           | Connecting from App Engine standard environment |\n| App Engine flexible environment | Same project: preconfigured Between projects: configure IAM           | Connecting from App Engine flexible environment |\n| Cloud Functions     | A Cloud SQL instance set up with a public IP.

As part of creating a Cloud SQL instance, you set up the default user (root) account. You can also create more users to give you finer-grained control over access to your instance.\nFor more information, see [PostgreSQL users](/sql/docs/postgres/users) and [ Creating and managing PostgreSQL users](/sql/docs/postgres/create-manage-users) .\n## What's next\n- Learn more about [how Cloud SQL works with PostgreSQL users](/sql/docs/postgres/users) .\n- Learn more about [PostgreSQL roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/user-manag.html) .\n- Learn more about your [options for connecting from an external application](/sql/docs/postgres/connect-overview) .\n- Learn about [controlling who can manage your Google Cloud Platform project](/sql/docs/postgres/roles-and-permissions) .", "guide": "Cloud SQL"}
