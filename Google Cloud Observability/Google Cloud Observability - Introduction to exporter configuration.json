These instructions apply only if you are using [managed collection](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/setup-managed) with Managed Service for Prometheus. If you are using self-deployed collection, see the relevant exporter documentation for information about where to find the exporter's source repository.\nThis document is not an exhaustive list of the exporters supported by Managed Service for Prometheus. You can configure managed collection to scrape any exporter that you can set up. This list provides instructions for some of the most commonly used exporters.\n", "content": "## Application exporters\nYou can use application exporters with Managed Service for Prometheus to collect metrics from third-party applications. These exporters are typically set up as standalone workloads or as sidecars to your existing GKE deployments.\nFor more information, see the following documents:\n- [Aerospike](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/aerospike) \n- [Apache ActiveMQ](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/activemq) \n- [Apache Airflow](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/airflow) \n- [Apache CouchDB](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/couchdb) \n- [Apache Flink](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/flink) \n- [Apache Hadoop](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/hadoop) \n- [Apache HBase](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/hbase) \n- [Apache Kafka](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/kafka) \n- [Apache Solr](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/solr) \n- [Apache Tomcat](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/tomcat) \n- [Apache Web Server (httpd)](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/apache) \n- [Apache Zookeeper](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/zookeeper) \n- [Argo Workflows](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/argo-workflows) \n- [Elasticsearch](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/elasticsearch) \n- [etcd](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/etcd) \n- [HAProxy](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/haproxy) \n- [HashiCorp Consul](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/consul) \n- [Ingress NGINX Controller](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/ingress-nginx) \n- [Jenkins](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/jenkins) \n- [Jetty](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/jetty) \n- [Kibana](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/kibana) \n- [Memcached](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/memcached) \n- [MongoDB](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/mongodb) \n- [MySQL](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/mysql) \n- [Nginx](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/nginx) \n- [PostgreSQL](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/postgresql) \n- [RabbitMQ](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/rabbitmq) \n- [Redis](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/redis) \n- [ScyllaDB](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/scylladb) \n- [Varnish](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/varnish) \n- [Velero](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/velero) ## Infrastructure exporters\nThe documents in this section contain example YAML manifests and other configuration that you can use to install and scrape infrastructure [exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) . For example, to replicate the experience of using the [kube-prometheus repository](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) , you can set up the [Kube State Metrics](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/kube_state_metrics) and [Node Exporter](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/node_exporter) exporters, and configure managed collection to scrape the [cAdvisor/Kubelet](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/kubelet-cadvisor) metrics.\nFor more information, see the following documents:\n- [GKE control-planemetrics](/stackdriver/docs/solutions/gke/managing-metrics#control-plane-metrics) \n- [Hubble (GKE Dataplane V2)](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/about-dpv2-observability) \n- [Istio](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/istio) \n- [Kube State Metrics](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/kube_state_metrics) \n- [cAdvisor/Kubelet](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/kubelet-cadvisor) \n- [Node Exporter](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/node_exporter) \n- [NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM)](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/nvidia-dcgm) \n- [Prometheus (self-monitoring)](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/prometheus)", "guide": "Google Cloud Observability"}
