There are no configuration options. If you provide an empty configuration objection, monitoring is enabled. If you do not provide a configuration object, monitoring is disabled. For example, when no other options are specified, an empty configuration section enables monitoring. export GRPC_GCP_OBSERVABILITY_CONFIG='{ \"project_id\": \"your-project-here\", \"cloud_monitoring\": { } }'                                                                                                         |\n| cloud_trace           | Object An empty configuration section enables tracing with the default configuration options.

For example, an empty configuration section enables tracing with default configuration options. export GRPC_GCP_OBSERVABILITY_CONFIG='{ \"project_id\": \"your-project-here\", \"cloud_trace\": { } }' When tracing is enabled, even with a `0` sampling rate, the decision to sample a particular trace is propagated.                                                                                            |\n| cloud_trace.sampling_rate       | Number The global setting that controls the probability of an RPC being traced. For example: The value 0.05 means that there's a 5% chance for an RPC to be traced. The value 1.0 means that every call is traced. The value 0 means don't start new traces. By default, the sampling_rate is 0. The plugin respects the sampling decision upstream. If an RPC is chosen for sampling upstream, the plugin collects spans and uploads the data to the backend, regardless of the sampling rate setting for the plugin.                                                                                   |\n| labels            | Object A JSON object containing a set of key-value pairs. Both key and value are strings. Labels are applied on Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, and Cloud Trace together.                                                                                                                                                                      |\n## Trace definitions\nThis section provides information on tracing.\n### Trace context propagation\nFor cross-service tracing to work, the service owner must support the propagation of trace context received from upstream (or started by itself) to downstream. Trace context is propagated among services through gRPC metadata. Make sure that you enable the Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, Cloud Trace APIs, and Microservices APIs, which let services in this configuration to report their telemetry data to the appropriate service.\nWithout propagation support, downstream services can't generate spans for a trace. Existing spans are not affected. The Microservices observability plugins support the [OpenCensus Binary Format](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-specs/blob/master/encodings/BinaryEncoding.md) for encoding and encoding trace context.\n### Spans\nThe name of a span is formatted as follows:\n| Type   | Example value       | Usage                                                 |\n|:-------------|:----------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| RPC span  | [Sent|Recv].helloworld.Greeter.SayHello | The span name is the full method name, connected by dots, with no prefix slash. Span names are prefixed with Sent. for CLIENT RPC span and Recv. for SERVER RPC span in front of the full method name. |\n| Attempt span | Attempt.helloworld.Greeter.SayHello  | Attaching a prefix Attempt. in front of the full method name.                                   |\n### Span labels\nThe integrations provide different span labels.\nFor attempt spans, two additional retry-related attributes (span labels) are attached:\n| Label     | Example value | Usage             |\n|:----------------------|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------------|\n| previous-rpc-attempts | 0    | The retry attempts count before this RPC.    |\n| transparent-retry  | True/False  | Whether this RPC is initiated by a transparent retry. |\n## Metrics definitions\nThe

For client header events, if timeout is set, payload includes timeout as well. |\n| payload.timeout  | String A string representing google.protobuf.Duration, such as \"1.2 s\". The RPC timeout value.                                                                                       |\n| payload.metadata  | Mapping[String, String] Used by header event or trailer event.                                                                                               |\n| payload.message  | String (Bytes) The message payload.                                                                                                      |\n| payload.messageLength | Int Size of the message, regardless of whether the full message is being logged (for example, they could be truncated or omitted).                                                                              |\n| payload.statusCode | String The gRPC status code.                                                                                                        |\n| payload.statusMessage | String The gRPC status message.                                                                                                       |\n| payload.statusDetails | String The value of the grpc-status-details-bin metadata key, if any. This is always an encoded google.rpc.Status message.                                                                                |\n| payloadTruncated  | Bool True if the message or metadata field is either truncated or omitted because of configuration options.                                                                                    |\n| sequenceId   | Int The message sequence ID for this call. The first message has a value of 1, to disambiguate from an unset value. The purpose of this field is to detect missing entries in environments where durability or ordering is not guaranteed.                                                    |\n## Resource labels\nResource labels identify the source that generates observability data. Each resource label is a key-value pair, where keys are predefined values that are specific to the source environment (for example, GKE or Compute Engine).\nFor metrics and tracing on GKE deployments, resource labels are populated by default except for the container name and namespace name. The missing values can be populated using the [Downward API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/#the-downward-api) .\nThe following are the environment variable keys:\n- CONTAINER_NAME\n- NAMESPACE\nFor example, the `env` section in the following includes two resource labels:\n```\napiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deploymentmetadata:\u00a0 labels:\u00a0 \u00a0 run: app1\u00a0 name: app1spec:\u00a0 replicas: 2\u00a0 selector:\u00a0 \u00a0 matchLabels:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 run: app1\u00a0 template:\u00a0 \u00a0 metadata:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 labels:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 run: app1\u00a0 \u00a0 spec:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 containers:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - image: 'o11y-examples:1.00'\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 name: container1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ports:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - protocol: TCP\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 containerPort: 50051\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 env:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - name: CONTAINER_NAME\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 value: container1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - name: NAMESPACE\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 valueFrom:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 fieldRef:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 fieldPath: metadata.namespace\n```\n## Custom labels\nCustom labels represent additional user-provided information in the observability data. Labels consist of a key and a value. The key-value pair is attached to tracing data as span labels, to metrics data as metrics labels, and to logging data as log entry labels. All custom labels are of the STRING type.\nYou can provide custom labels in the configuration by specifying a list of key- value pairs for `labels` . The implementation reads the configuration and creates a separate label for each key-value pair, then attaches the label to the observability data. For example:\n```\n\"labels\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \"DATACENTER\": \"SAN_JOSE_DC\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \"APP_ID\": \"24512\"\u00a0 }\n```\nEach log entry has the following additional labels in them:\n```\n{\u00a0 \u00a0\"DATACENTER\": \"SAN_JOSE_DC\"\u00a0 \u00a0\"APP_ID\": \"24512\"}\n```\n## What's next\n- For information on metrics kinds and types, see [Value types and metric kinds](/monitoring/api/v3/kinds-and-types) .\n- For information on distributions, see the [Distribution reference page](/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/TypedValue#Distribution) .\n- For information about charting Distribution metrics, see [Distribution metrics](/monitoring/charts/charting-distribution-metrics) .\n- For information on units (such as`1`,`ms`and`By`), see the [unit field](/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors#MetricDescriptor.FIELDS.unit) in the`MetricDescriptor`reference.", "guide": "Google Cloud Observability"}
