For more information, refer to the [Chef Integration](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ops-agents-chef/blob/master/README.md) documentation.\n- **Puppet** : by using the Puppet module, you can install and configure the agent across your fleet of Linux and Windows VMs. Note that for Windows VMs, only the Ops Agent is supported. For more information, refer to the [Puppet Integration](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ops-agents-puppet/blob/master/README.md) documentation.\n- **Terraform** : by using the Terraform module, you can install and configure the agent on VMs with [supported operating systems](/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/logging/managing-agent-policies#supported_operating_systems) . For more information, refer to the [Terraform AgentPolicy](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/cloud-operations/google/latest/submodules/agent-policy) documentation.\n- **Agent Policy using gcloud CLI** : by using the Google Cloud CLI, you can create an Agent Policy that governs new and existing VMs with [supported operating systems](/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/logging/managing-agent-policies#supported_operating_systems) , ensuring proper installation and optional auto-upgrade of all agents. For more information, see the document [Managing Agent Policies](/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/logging/managing-agent-policies) ", "content": ".", "guide": "Google Cloud Observability"}
