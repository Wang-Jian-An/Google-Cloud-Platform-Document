Configuration is only possible when the legacy Monitoring agent is running on Linux. The agent on Windows monitors IIS and MS SQL applications; however, on these systems the agent cannot be configured to collect metrics from other third-party applications.\nSee [Agent metrics](/monitoring/api/metrics_agent) for a list of the available metrics from the third-party applications. The configuration files are in the Monitoring agent's [GitHub configurationrepository](https://github.com/Stackdriver/stackdriver-agent-service-configs) .\nAfter you have [installed the legacy Monitoringagent](/monitoring/agent/monitoring/installation) , see the following configuration instructions for supported third-party applications:\n- [Apache web server](/monitoring/agent/plugins/apache) \n- [JVM Monitoring](/monitoring/agent/plugins/jvm) \n- [Memcached](/monitoring/agent/plugins/memcached) \n- [MySQL](/monitoring/agent/plugins/mysql) \n- [Nginx](/monitoring/agent/plugins/nginx) \n- [Redis](/monitoring/agent/plugins/redis) \n- [StatsD](/monitoring/agent/plugins/statsd) \nThe Cloud Monitoring **Metrics Management** page provides information that can help you control the amount you spend on chargeable metrics without affecting observability. The **Metrics Management** page reports the following information:\n- Ingestion volumes for both byte- and sample-based billing, across metric  domains and for individual metrics.\n- Data about labels and cardinality of metrics.\n- Use of metrics in alerting policies and custom dashboards.\n- Rate of metric-write errors.\n**Metrics Management**\n[View and manage metric usage](/monitoring/docs/metrics-management", "content": ")", "guide": "Google Cloud Observability"}
