{"title": "Cloud Text-to-Speech API - List all supported voices", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/list-voices", "abstract": "# Cloud Text-to-Speech API - List all supported voices\nYou can get a complete list of all the supported voices by calling the [voices:list](/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rest/v1/voices/list) endpoint of the API. You can also find the complete list of voices available on the [Supported Voices](/text-to-speech/docs/voices) page.\nThe following code snippets demonstrate how to list the voices available in the Text-to-Speech API for text-to-speech synthesis.\nThese samples require that you have installed and initialized the Google Cloud CLI. For information about setting up the gcloud CLI, see [Authenticate to TTS](/text-to-speech/docs/authentication) .\nRefer to the [voices:list](/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rest/v1/voices/list) API endpoint for complete details.\nTo get a list of the available voices for text-to-speech synthesis, make a GET request to the [voices:list](/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rest/v1/voices/list) API endpoint. Replace `` with your project ID.\n```\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 -H \"x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 -H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \"https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/voices\"\n```\nThe Text-to-Speech API returns a JSON-formatted result that looks similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"voices\": [ {\n  \"languageCodes\": [  \"es-ES\"\n  ],\n  \"name\": \"es-ES-Standard-A\",\n  \"ssmlGender\": \"FEMALE\",\n  \"naturalSampleRateHertz\": 24000\n },\n {\n  \"languageCodes\": [  \"ja-JP\"\n  ],\n  \"name\": \"ja-JP-Standard-A\",\n  \"ssmlGender\": \"FEMALE\",\n  \"naturalSampleRateHertz\": 22050\n },\n {\n  \"languageCodes\": [  \"pt-BR\"\n  ],\n  \"name\": \"pt-BR-Standard-A\",\n  \"ssmlGender\": \"FEMALE\",\n  \"naturalSampleRateHertz\": 24000\n },\n  ...\n ]\n}\n```To learn how to install and use the client library for Text-to-Speech, see [Text-to-Speech client libraries](/text-to-speech/docs/libraries) .
