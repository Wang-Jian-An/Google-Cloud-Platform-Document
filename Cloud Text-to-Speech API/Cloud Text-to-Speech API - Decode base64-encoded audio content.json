You can read the binary data directly from a gRPC response; however, JSON is used when responding to a REST request. Because JSON is a text format that does not directly support binary data, Text-to-Speech returns a response string encoded in [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) . You must convert the base64-encoded text data from the response to binary before you can play it on a device.\nJSON responses from the Text-to-Speech include base64-encoded audio content in the `audioContent` field. For example:\n```\n{\n \"audioContent\": \"//NExAARqoIIAAhEuWAAAGNmBGMY4EBcxvABAXBPmPIAF//yAuh9Tn5CEap3/o...\"\n}\n```\nTo decode base64 into an audio file:\n- Copy only the base-64 encoded content into a text file.\n- Decode the source text file using the base64 command line tool by using the `-d` flag:\n```\n\u00a0 \u00a0 $ base64 SOURCE_BASE64_TEXT_FILE -d > DESTINATION_AUDIO_FILE\n```- Copy only the base-64 encoded content into a text file.\n- Decode the source text file using the base64 command line tool:\n```\n\u00a0 \u00a0 $ base64 --decode -i SOURCE_BASE64_TEXT_FILE > DESTINATION_AUDIO_FILE\n```- Copy only the base-64 encoded content into a text file.\n- Decode the source text file using the [certutil](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil) command.\n```\n\u00a0 \u00a0certutil -decode SOURCE_BASE64_TEXT_FILE DESTINATION_AUDIO_FILE\n``", "content": "`", "guide": "Cloud Text-to-Speech API"}
