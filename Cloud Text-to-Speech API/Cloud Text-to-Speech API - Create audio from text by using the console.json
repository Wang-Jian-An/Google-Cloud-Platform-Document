In this quickstart, you will create audio from text and learn how to playback, download, and update this audio for your own applications.\nTo learn more about the fundamental concepts in Text-to-Speech, read [Text-to-Speech Basics](/text-to-speech/docs/basics) .", "content": "## Before you beginBefore you can begin using the Text-to-Speech console, you must enable the API in the Google Cloud console. The steps below walk you through the following actions:- Enable Text-to-Speech on a project.\n- Make sure billing is enabled for Text-to-Speech.\n### Set up your Google Cloud project\n- [Sign in to the Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) \n- [Goto the project selector page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard) You can either choose an existing project or create a new one. For more details about creating a project, see [GoogleCloud Platform documentation](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) .\n- If you create a new project, you will be prompted to link a billing account to this project. If you are using a pre-existing project, make sure that you have billing enabled. [Learnhow to confirm that billing is enabled for your project](/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) **Note:** You must enable billing to use Text-to-Speech API, however you will not be charged unless you exceed the free quota. See the [pricing](/text-to-speech/pricing) page for more details.\n- Once you have selected a project and linked it to a billing account, you can enable the Text-to-Speech API. Go to the **Search products and resources** bar at the top of the page and type in **\"text-to-speech\"** .\n- Select the **Cloud Text-to-Speech API** from the list of results.\n- To try Text-to-Speech without linking it to your project, choose the **TRY THIS API** option. To enable the Text-to-Speech API for use with your project, click **ENABLE** .\n## Create Audio from TextUse the Google Cloud console to create audio from text:\n### Enter Text or SSML\n- Open the [Text-to-Speechsynthesize](https://console.cloud.google.com/speech/text-to-speech) .\n- Enter your **Text or SSML** . You can synthesize either plain text or use [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/) to allow for more customization in your audio response.\n- Click **Continue** . You will be taken to **Setup Configuration** .\n### Setup Configuration\n- Select the **language** of your text or SSML. This is the language that will be used for synthesis.\n- Select the **voice** that you want to use for synthesis. Note that voice features, characteristics, and costs vary.\n- Click **Continue** . You will be taken to **Advanced settings** .\n### Advanced settings (optional)\n- Optionally specify additional characteristics of your synthesized audio such as **speech** and **pitch** .\n- At the bottom, click **Synthesize** to create your synthesized audio.\n### Review your audioDepending on your input, the synthesized audio may take from seconds to minutes to create. Once your audio has been created, it's ready for review.- Click on the player controls to play the audio.\n- Click on **Download** to download the audio file locally.\n## Clean upTo avoid unnecessary Google Cloud charges, use the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to delete your project if you do not need it.## What's next\n- Learn more about Cloud Text-to-Speech by reading the [basics](/text-to-speech/docs/basics) .\n- Review the list of [available voices](/text-to-speech/docs/voices) you can use for synthetic speech.", "guide": "Cloud Text-to-Speech API"}
