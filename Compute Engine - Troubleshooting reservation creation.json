If your issue is not listed on this page, you might find the error by trying to [create VMs](/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance) with the resources that you want to reserve and reviewing the [Troubleshooting VM creation](/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-vm-creation) page.\n", "content": "## Reservation creation errors\nIf you can't create a reservation, it might be due to one of the errors in this section. If you can't create a shared reservation, also review [Shared reservation creation errors](#creating_shared_reservations) .\n### Insufficient quota\nA quota error occurs when a resource request exceeds your quota.\n**Error messages:**\n```\nRESOURCE_NAME creation failed:\nQuota QUOTA_NAME exceeded. Limit: QUOTA_LIMIT in region REGION\n```\n```\nRESOURCE_NAME creation failed:\nQuota QUOTA_NAME exceeded. Limit: QUOTA_LIMIT in zone ZONE\n```\n```\nResource exhausted (HTTP 429): QUOTA_EXCEEDED\n```\n**Resolution:** Request a higher quota limit. For more information, see [Requesting an increase in quota](/compute/quotas#requesting_additional_quota) .\n### Resource availability\nTo create a reservation, all the resources you specify in the reservation must be available in the specified in order for them to be reserved for you.\nThe following are examples of common resource errors that you might encounter when you request new Compute Engine resources or create new reservations:\n```\nZONE_RESOURCE_POOL_EXHAUSTED\n```\n```\nZONE_RESOURCE_POOL_EXHAUSTED_WITH_DETAILS\n```\n```\nThe zone 'projects/PROJECT_ID/zones/ZONE' does not have enough resources available to fulfill the request.\nTry a different zone, or try again later.\n```\n```\nA VM_TYPE_AND_SIZE VM instance with RESOURCE_ATTACHMENT is currently unavailable in the ZONE zone.\nCapacity changes frequently, so try your request in a different zone, with a different VM hardware\nconfiguration, or at a later time. For more options, see troubleshooting documentation.\n```\n```\nA VM_TYPE_AND_SIZE VM instance with RESOURCE_ATTACHMENT is currently unavailable in the ZONE zone, because of REASON.\nConsider trying your request in the ZONE zone(s), which currently has capacity to accommodate your request.\nIf you cannot move your VM to ZONE, review the REASON failure resolution instructions available in troubleshooting documentation, then try your request again.\nIf your workload can't accommodate the suggested resolution, try your request with a different VM hardware configuration or at a later time.\n```\nTo learn how to resolve resource errors, see [Troubleshooting resource availability errors](/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-resource-availability) .\n### Zone availability\nIf you receive a `notFound` or `does not exist in zone` error when requesting new resources, it means that the zone you are requesting the resource in does not offer the resource or machine type that you have requested.\n**Error messages** :\n```\nnotFound\n```\n```\ndoes not exist in zone\n```\n**Resolution** : See [Regions and zones](/compute/docs/regions-zones) to find out which features are available in each zone.\n### Resource name\nIf you receive a `resource already exists` error when you try to create a resource, your creation request failed because you specified a non-unique name for the resource for the specified location and project.\n**Error messages** :\n```\nThe resource 'projects/PROJECT_NAME/zones/ZONE/RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_NAME' already exists\"\n```\n```\nThe resource 'projects/PROJECT_NAME/regions/REGION/RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_NAME' already exists\"\n```\n**Resolution** : Retry your creation request with a [unique resource name](/compute/docs/naming-resources#name_uniqueness) .\n### Maximum VM count exceeded\nThe following error occurs when you try to create a reservation for more than 1000 VMs.\n**Error message** :\n```\nInvalid value for field 'resource.specificReservation.count': VM_COUNT. Must be less than or equal to 1000\n```\n**Resolution** : Create multiple reservations with the same zone, project, and VM properties as this reservation, but reduce the number of VMs you want to reserve to up to 1000 VMs for each reservation.\n## Shared reservation creation errors\nIf you can't create a shared reservation, it might be due to one of the errors in this section or in [Reservation creation errors](#creating-reservations) .\n### Project without an organization\nThe following error occurs when you try to create a shared reservation in a project that does not belong to an organization.\n**Error message** :\n```\nCannot create Shared Reservations in a project that does not belong to an organization.\n```\n**Resolution** : Do one of the following:\n- [Migrate this project to an organization](/resource-manager/docs/project-migration#migrating_projects_no_org) before using it to create a shared reservation.\n- Create a shared reservation using a project that belongs to an [organization](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization) .\n### Constraint violation\nThe following error occurs when the [Shared Reservations Owner Projects (compute.sharedReservationsOwnerProjects) organization policy constraint](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#shared_reservation_constraint) does not allow a project to create and modify shared reservations.\n**Error message** :\n```\nConstraint constraints/compute.sharedReservationsOwnerProjects violated for project projects/PROJECT_NUMBER\nShared reservation can not be created in this project for your organization.\n```\n**Resolution** : Do one of the following:\n- Use a project that is allowed to create and modify shared reservations. To see which projects in your organization have this permission, [view the shared reservations organization policy constraint](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#viewing_the_shared_reservations_organization_policy_constraint) .\n- Grant the project permission to create and modify shared reservations by [editing the shared reservations organization policy constraint](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#editing_the_shared_reservations_organization_policy_constraint) . If you continue to see this error after editing, you might just need to wait a few minutes for the edit to take effect.\n### Invalid consumer projects\nThis section describes errors that occur when you specify invalid consumer projects for a shared reservation.\nThe following error occurs when the consumer project you specified cannot be found in the same organization as the project you are currently using.\n**Error message** :\n```\nProject PROJECT_ID doesn't exist or doesn't belong to the same organization of the current project.\n```\nWhere is a project ID that you specified as a consumer project.\n**Resolution** : Do the following:\n- [View all the projects in the organization](/resource-manager/docs/organization-resource-management#viewing_all_projects_in_an_organization) to verify that the specified consumer project exists in this organization.\n- [View the project](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) to verify that you specified its project ID,, correctly.The following error occurs when you try to specify a shared reservation's owner project (the project used to create the shared reservation) as a consumer project.\n**Error message** :\n```\nProject PROJECT_ID which is the owner project of this reservation is always included in the share projects, please do not add it.\n```\n**Resolution** : Remove the owner project from the list of consumer projects. A shared reservation can always be consumed by VMs in the owner project, so you cannot include it in the list of consumer projects.\nThe following error occurs when a shared reservation has zero consumer projects:\n**Error message** :\n```\nHave to share with at least 1 project.\n```\n**Resolution** : Do one of the following:\n- Specify at least one consumer project to share this reservation with. For more information, see [Create a shared reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#creating_a_shared_reservation) .\n- Use a [single-project reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project) instead of a shared reservation.The following error occurs when a shared reservation has more than 100 consumer projects:\n**Error message** :\n```\nCan only share with at most 100 projects.\n```\n**Resolution** : Do the following:\n- Reduce the number of consumer projects to, at most, 100 consumer projects for the shared reservation.\n- If you still need to reserve capacity for any omitted projects, [create another shared reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#creating_a_shared_reservation) that is shared with those projects.\n### Maximum shared reservation count exceeded\nThe following error occurs when your organization already has 100 shared reservations with the same VM properties.\n**Error message** :\n```\nCannot support more than 100 shared reservations of the same shape under an organization.\n```\n**Resolution** : Follow the [best practice](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#best_practices) of minimizing the number of separate shared reservations with the same [VM properties](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-overview#requirements) in your organization by doing the following:\n- [Resize existing reservations](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-modify#resizing_a_reservation) to have larger VM counts. If you have multiple identical shared reservations that do not exceed the [maximum VM count](#max-vm-count-exceeded) , then consider if you can combine them into fewer shared reservations with the same combined VM count.\n- [Modify the consumer projects for a shared reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-modify#modifying-consumer-projects-shared-reservation) to include more projects. For example, if you have multiple shared reservations with the same VM properties and zone but similar owner and consumer projects, consider if you can combine them into one shared reservation that can be consumed by all of these projects.\n- [Delete shared reservations](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-delete#deleting_a_reservation) that you no longer need.## Reservations from instance templates creation errors\nIf you fail to create a reservation by [specifying an instance template](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project#specify-instance-template) , it might be due to one of the errors in this section.\n### Cross project referencing is not allowed\nThe following error occurs when you try to create a reservation by specifying an instance template from another project.\n**Error message** :\n```\nCross project referencing is not allowed for this resource.\n```\n**Resolution** : Do the following:\n- Make sure that the project ID and instance template's name you specify in your reservation are correct. To check that an instance template exists, [get information about the template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#get_information_about_an_instance_template) or [list the template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#list_instance_templates) .\n- An instance template contains project-specific settings, so you can only access and use an instance template within the same project. Instead, do one of the following:- To create a reservation by specifying an instance template:- [Create a new instance template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/create-instance-templates#based-on-existing-template) within your project.\n- Specify the newly created instance template when creating a [single-project](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project#specify-instance-template) or [shared reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#specify-instance-template) . **Caution:** Create your reservation in the same region and zone as the resources within the instance template. Any [ regional](/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources#regionalresources) or [ zonal resources](/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources#zoneresource) that are specified in an instance template\u2014such as a machine type or a disk\u2014restrict the use of the template to the locations where those resources exist. For example, if your instance template specifies an existing disk in `us-central1-a` zone, then you must create your reservation in the same zone. Otherwise, creating the reservation or the VMs that can consume the reservation fails.To check if an existing template specifies any resources that bind the template to a specific region or zone, [ get information about the instance template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#get_information_about_an_instance_template) and look for references to regional or zonal resources inside of it.\n- To create a reservation without specifying an instance template, create a [single-project](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project#specify-vm-properties) or [shared reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#specify-vm-properties) by specifying VM properties directly.\n### Instance template not found\nThe following error occurs when you try to create a reservation by specifying an instance template that doesn't exist.\n**Error message** :\n```\nSource resource reference provided invalid.\n```\n**Resolution** : Check if the name of the instance template you specified is correct. Then\u2014 you [list instance templates](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#list_instance_templates) to check that your template doesn't exist and your project doesn't have another template that you want to use\u2014you can [create a new instance template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/create-instance-templates#create_a_new_instance_template) .\n### Invalid zone for an instance template\nThe following error occurs when you try to create a reservation by specifying an instance template, and you specify an invalid location for your instance template.\n**Error message** :\n```\nReservation cannot be created outside the zone/region of source resource.\n```\n**Resolution** : Do one of the following:\n- Make sure to create your reservation in the same region and zone as the resources within the instance template. Any [regional](/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources#regionalresources) or [zonal resources](/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources#zoneresource) that are specified in an instance template\u2014such as a machine type or a disk\u2014restrict the use of the template to the locations where those resources exist. For example, if your instance template specifies an existing disk in the `us-central1-a` zone, then you must create your reservation in the same zone. Otherwise, creating the reservation or the VMs that can consume the reservation fails.To check if an existing template specifies any resources that bind the template to a specific region or zone, [get information about the template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#get_information_about_an_instance_template) and look for references to regional or zonal resources inside of it.\n- Use an instance template that doesn't restrict to a specific region or zone. Because you can't update instance templates, do the following:- [Create a new instance template based on an existing template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/create-instance-templates#based-on-existing-template) with the updated properties.\n- Create a [single-project](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project#specify-instance-template) or [shared reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#specify-instance-template) by specifying the newly created instance template.\n- Optional: [Delete the older instance template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#delete_an_instance_template) .\n### Override instance template properties\nThe following error occurs when you try to create a reservation by specifying an instance template, and you specify both an instance template and VM properties when creating the reservation.\n**Error message** :\n```\nReservation cannot override properties populated by source resource.\n```\n**Resolution** : Do one of the following:\n- To create a reservation by specifying an instance template, make sure to remove field that specifies VM properties.\n- To create a reservation by specifying an instance template with different VM properties, do the following:- You can't update an existing instance template. Instead, [create a new instance template based on an existing template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/create-instance-templates#based-on-existing-template) .\n- Specify the newly created instance template when creating a [single-project](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project#specify-instance-template) or [shared reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#specify-instance-template) . **Caution:** Create your reservation in the same region and zone as the resources within the instance template.

For example, if your instance template specifies an existing disk in the `us-central1-a` zone, then you must create your reservation in the same zone. Otherwise, creating the reservation or the VMs that can consume the reservation fails.To check if an existing template specifies any resources that bind the template to a specific region or zone, [describe the instance template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#get_information_about_an_instance_template) and look for references to regional or zonal resources inside of it.\n- Optional: [Delete the older instance template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#delete_an_instance_template) .\n- To create a reservation without specifying an instance template, create instead a [single-project](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project#specify-vm-properties) or [shared reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-shared#specify-vm-properties) by specifying VM properties directly.## Reservations with compact placement policies creation errors\nIf you fail to create a reservation by specifying a [compact placement policy](/compute/docs/instances/use-compact-placement-policies) , it might be due to one of the errors in this section.\n### A compact placement policy is already specified in another reservation\nThe following error occurs when you try to create a reservation by specifying a compact placement policy, and the compact placement policy is already specified in another reservation.\n**Error message** :\n```\nPlacement policy has been used by another reservation.\n```\n**Resolution** : You can use compact placement policy only per reservation. You can't share compact placement policies across reservations. If you want to use a similar compact placement policy for another reservation, select one of the following methods:\n- To create a reservation by specifying an instance template that includes a compact placement policy, follow these steps:- [Create a new compact placement policy](/compute/docs/instances/use-compact-placement-policies#create-compact-policy) .\n- Create a new instance template by [specifying the newly created compact placement policy](/compute/docs/instance-templates/create-instance-templates#create_a_new_instance_template) . **Important:** Placement policies are [regional resources](/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources#regionalresources) . If you specify a placement policy when creating an instance template, the policy restricts the use of the template to the region where the policy exists. For example, if you create a compact placement policy in `us-central1` , you can only use the template to create VMs or reservations within the same region. Otherwise, you encounter [issues](#invalid-zone-placement-policy) .\n- Create a reservation by [specifying the newly created instance template](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project#specify-instance-template) .\n- Optional: [Delete the older instance template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#delete_an_instance_template) .\n- To create a reservation by specifying VM properties and a compact placement policy directly, follow these steps:- [Create a new compact placement policy](/compute/docs/instances/use-compact-placement-policies#create-compact-policy) .\n- Create a reservation by [specifying the new compact placement policy directly](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project#specify-vm-properties) .\n### Attempt to create an automatically consumed reservation\nThe following error occurs when you try to create an automatically consumed reservation and specify a compact placement policy.\n```\nPlacement policy only supports specific reservations.\n```\n**Resolution** : You can only specify a compact placement policy when creating a [specifically targeted reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-consume#consuming_instances_from_a_specific_reservation) .\n### Attempt to create a shared reservation\nThe following error occurs when you try to create a shared reservation by specifying a compact placement policy.\n**Error message** :\n```\nCreating shared reservations with placement policy is not supported.\n```\n**Resolution** : You can specify a compact placement policy only for [single-project reservations](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project) . Thus, create a new reservation a new compact placement policy for each project you wanted to initially share your shared reservation with.\n### Attempt to specify a compact placement policy with a max-distance value of 1\nThe following error occurs when you try to specify a compact placement policy with a `max-distance` value of `1` in a single-project reservation.\n**Error message** :\n```\nResource policies with max-distance less than 2 are not supported.\n```\n**Resolution** : You can't specify compact placement policies with a `max-distance` value of `1` when creating a single-project reservation. Instead, do the following:\n- [Create a new compact placement policy](/compute/docs/instances/use-compact-placement-policies#create-compact-policy) that doesn't specify a `max-distance` value of `1` .\n- Do one of the following:- Create a single-project reservation by specifying an instance template by doing the following:- You can't modify the properties of an existing instance template. Instead, [create a new instance template](/compute/docs/instances/use-compact-placement-policies#create-instance-template) that specifies the newly created compact placement policy.\n- [Create a reservation by specifying the newly created instance template](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project#specify-instance-template) .\n- Optional: [Delete the old instance template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#delete_an_instance_template) .\n- [Create a single-project reservation by specifying properties directly](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-single-project#specify-vm-properties) and specify the newly created compact placement policy.Additionally, if you no longer need the old compact placement policy, see how to [delete the placement policy](/compute/docs/instances/manage-placement-policies#delete-policy) .\n### Attempt to specify a spread placement policy\nThe following error occurs when you try to specify a spread placement policy in a reservation.\n**Error message** :\n```\nOnly compact placement policy is allowed with reservation.\n```\n**Resolution** : When creating a reservation, you can only specify a [compact placement policy](/compute/docs/instances/use-compact-placement-policies) .
