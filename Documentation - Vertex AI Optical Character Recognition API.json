For more information, see [View   Vertex AI service statuses and endpoints](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/application/ao-user/vertex-ai-api-status) OCR and Optical Character Recognition are not formal product names, so don't appear in _product_names.html. However, the PM would like to treat it as a product name for GDCH with title-case in the long form. These variables enforce that for GDCH. \n## google.cloud.vision.v1.ImageAnnotator\n| Methods    | Methods.1                 |\n|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| BatchAnnotateFiles | Service that performs image detection and annotation for a batch of files. |\n| BatchAnnotateImages | Run image detection and annotation for a batch of images.     |", "guide": "Documentation"}
