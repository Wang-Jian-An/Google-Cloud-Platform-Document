{"title": "Apigee - Step 3: Install ASM", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/what-apigee", "abstract": "# Apigee - Step 3: Install ASM\nYou are currently viewing version 1.4 of the Apigee hybrid documentation. **This version is end of life.** You should upgrade to a newer version. For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\n", "content": "## \n Install ASM\nApigee hybrid uses the Istio distribution provided with Anthos Service Mesh (ASM). Follow these steps to install ASM in your cluster.### \n Supported ASM versions\n- For new hybrid version 1.4.4 installations, install ASM version 1.7.x.\n- For upgrades from previous versions of hybrid, install ASM version 1.6.x.\n### \n Perform ASM setup and configuration steps\nTo complete the ASM installation, you must first follow ASM-specific setup and configuration steps in the ASM documentation. Then, you must return here to complete the hybrid-specific configuration before applying the configuration to the cluster.\nThe instructions to install and configure ASM are different depending on your platform. Choose the steps your platform below.\nThe following configuration assumes that clients will be SNI enabled by default. If they are not, see the instructions to [Enable non-SNI and HTTP clients](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.4/enable-non-sni) .\n- Follow the ASM setup and configuration steps: **Important: ** When following the ASM documentation, **do not** install or apply the YAML configuration file`istio-operator.yaml`when   instructed to do so. At that time, we require you to return to this page  to edit the file with further hybrid-specific configurations before installing/applying   the configuration.- If this is a new installation of Apigee hybrid install the ASM version   1.7.. Go to: [New installation](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/archive/1.7/docs/scripted-install/gke-asm-onboard-1-7#new_installation) .\n- If you are upgrading from a previous version of hybrid, use ASM 1.6.x. Go to: [Introduction to the installation and migration](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/archive/1.6/docs/gke-install-overview) .\n- When you have completed the ASM setup and config steps, go to the next section   to complete the hybrid configuration and ASM installation steps.\n### \n  Perform final hybrid configuration and install ASM\n  Finally, add hybrid-specific configurations to the `istio-operator.yaml` file and install ASM.- Ensure that you're in the ASM installation's root directory. For example:`1.7.3-asm.6`.\n- Open the`istio-operator.yaml`file in an editor.- In **ASM 1.7.x** :`./asm/istio/istio-operator.yaml`\n- In **ASM 1.6.x** :`./asm/cluster/istio-operator.yaml`\n- Add (or update) the`spec:components`stanza in the`istio-operator.yaml`file below the`meshConfig:`section and immediately above`values:`, whereis an IP address your runtime ingress gateway can use. If you do  not have a reserved static IP address, for this Quick Start, you can leave the`LoadBalancerIP`property out.\n```\n components:\n ingressGateways:\n - name: istio-ingressgateway\n  enabled: true\n  k8s:\n  service:\n   type: LoadBalancer\n   loadBalancerIP: static_ip # If you do not have a reserved static IP, leave this out.\n   ports:\n   - name: status-port\n   port: 15021 # for ASM 1.7.x and above, else 15020\n   targetPort: 15021 # for ASM 1.7.x and above, else 15020\n   - name: http2\n   port: 80\n   targetPort: 8080\n   - name: https\n   port: 443\n   targetPort: 8443\n``` \n```\napiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1kind: IstioOperatormetadata:\u00a0 clusterName: \"hybrid-example/us-central1/example-cluster\" # {\"$ref\":\"#/definitions/io.k8s.cli.substitutions.cluster-name\"}spec:\u00a0 profile: asm\u00a0 hub: gcr.io/gke-release/asm # {\"$ref\":\"#/definitions/io.k8s.cli.setters.anthos.servicemesh.hub\"}\u00a0 tag: 1.5.7-asm.0 # {\"$ref\":\"#/definitions/io.k8s.cli.setters.anthos.servicemesh.tag\"}\u00a0 meshConfig:\u00a0 \u00a0 defaultConfig:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 proxyMetadata:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GCP_METADATA: \"hybrid-example|123456789123|example-cluster|us-central1\" #\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 {\"$ref\":\"#/definitions/io.k8s.cli.substitutions.gke-metadata\"}\u00a0 components:\u00a0 \u00a0 pilot:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 k8s:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 hpaSpec:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 maxReplicas: 2\u00a0 \u00a0 ingressGateways:\u00a0 \u00a0 - name: istio-ingressgateway\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 enabled: true\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 k8s:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 service:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 type: LoadBalancer\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 loadBalancerIP: 123.234.56.78\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ports:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - name: status-port\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 port: 15021 # for ASM 1.7.x and above, else 15020\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 targetPort: 15021 # for ASM 1.7.x and above, else 15020\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - name: http2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 port: 80\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 targetPort: 8080\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - name: https\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 port: 443\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 targetPort: 8443\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 hpaSpec:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 maxReplicas: 2\u00a0 values:\u00a0 \u00a0 .\u00a0 \u00a0 .\u00a0 \u00a0 .\n```\n- Return now to the ASM documentation you used previously, and complete ASM installation (install or apply the`istio-operator.yaml`file to the cluster). If you are on ASM 1.6 and given a choice, choose **PERMISSIVE mTLS** . **Note: ** If you are on ASM 1.6, we recommend that you use the`asmctl validate`command to validate the configuration and health of the installed components. This command is described in the ASM documentation section on validating the installation. This command is only valid if you are on ASM 1.6.\n## \n Set up and download ASM\nUse the ASM documentation to set up your environment and download ASM.- Read the following steps carefully before you begin. We will ask you to perform some of the steps listed in the ASM documentation, then return here to complete the installation.\n- Go to [Installing Anthos Service Mesh on premises](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/archive/1.7/docs/gke-on-prem-install) and perform all of the ASM steps up to and including [Create  the istio-system namespace](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/archive/1.7/docs/gke-on-prem-install#create_the_istio-system_namespace) , then stop and go to the next section [Apply the manifest](#apply-the-manifest) below. **Important: ** After completing the steps in the section [Create  the istio-system namespace](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/archive/1.7/docs/gke-on-prem-install#create_the_istio-system_namespace) , stop and continue with the steps listed in the  next section. We recommend that you wait to apply the manifest file until instructed below.\n## \n Apply the manifest\n **When you have downloaded and unzipped the ASM installation file** , continue with the following steps:- Make sure you are in the Istio directory that you downloaded and unzipped. For example:`1.7.3-asm.6`.\n- Execute the following command, whereis a static IP address that the  istio ingress component can use. If you do not have a static IP address reserved, leave the`--set values.gateways.istio-ingressgateway.loadBalancerIP`line out:```\n./bin/istioctl install --set profile=asm-multicloud \\\n --set values.gateways.istio-ingressgateway.loadBalancerIP=your_static_IP\n```\n- Finally, return to the ASM documentation to [Check  the control plane components](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/archive/1.7/docs/gke-on-prem-install#check_the_control_plane_components) to validate your installation.\n## \n Customizing the ASM installation\nThe ASM installation you just performed is a minimal installation, sufficient to test and use Apigee hybrid for basic use cases.
