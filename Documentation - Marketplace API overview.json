The APIs are used for the provisioning and administration of the Marketplace services in a given project through actions that include installing, upgrading, and uninstalling. The GDCH Marketplace APIs are also used to see available versions, create, modify, or delete objects in your project to install, upgrade, or uninstall instances of a service.\n", "content": "## Service endpoint and discovery document\nThe following URL is the API endpoint for the Marketplace APIs: `https://` `` `/apis/marketplace.gdc.goog/v1` where `` is the endpoint of the GDCH API server.\nUsing the `kubectl proxy` command, you can access that URL in your browser or with a tool such as `curl` to get the discovery document for the Marketplace API. The `kubectl proxy` command opens up a proxy to the Kubernetes API server on your local machine. When the command is running, access the document at the following URL:\n`http://127.0.0.1:8001/apis/marketplace.gdc.goog/v1`\nCreate an object in a project's namespace with `kubectl create` to install the service you want. To upgrade a service instance, modify it to indicate which version of that service. You can modify the object directly with an HTTP client or by using the `kubectl apply` , `kubectl patch` , or `kubectl edit` commands. To uninstall a service instance, delete the object with `kubectl delete` .", "guide": "Documentation"}
