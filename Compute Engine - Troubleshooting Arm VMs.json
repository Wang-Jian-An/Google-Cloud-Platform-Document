The most common issues are using an incompatible machine type or OS image for your Arm VM.\nAnother possible cause is creating an Arm VM using a boot disk from an x86 VM. The architecture of the boot disk must match that of the virtual machine. Compute Engine checks that the boot disk architecture matches the VM architecture, but the validations might not work with custom images.\n**Error message** :\nUsing a boot disk with an x86 architecture with an Arm VM results in a failure very early in the boot process, with the main symptom being that you can't access the VM using `ssh` . Because the VM is not functional, the only way to verify the problem is through serial console logs, which should look similar to the following, repeating infinitely:\n```\nBdsDxe: failed to load Boot0001 \"UEFI nvme_card-pd\" from PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,\n0x0)/NVMe(0x1,00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00): Not Found\nEMU Variable FVB Started\nEMU Variable invalid PCD sizes\nFound PL031 RTC @ 0x9010000\nInitializeRealTimeClock: using default timezone/daylight settings\n[2J[01;01H[=3h[2J[01;01H\nUEFI: Failed to load image.\nDescription: UEFI nvme_card-pd\nFilePath: PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)/NVMe(0x1,00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00)\nOptionNumber: 1.\nStatus: Not Found.\n```\n**Resolution** :\nCheck that your VM instance is running on an Arm compatible machine type and OS image. Don't use a boot disk from an x86 VM to create the VM. Recreate the Arm VM.\nFor information about the available Arm images, see [Operating system details](/compute/docs/images/os-details) .\n## Errors when updating VMs\nIf you can't update a VM instance, it might be due to the following issue.\n### Error when changing the machine type\nThe following errors might occur when you try to change the machine type of a VM:\n```\nERROR: (gcloud.compute.instances.set-machine-type) Could not fetch resource:\n - Invalid resource usage: 'Requested boot disk architecture (X86_64) is not compatible with machine type architecture (ARM64).'\n```\n**Resolution:**\n- Make sure that your VM supports the processor of the new machine type. For more information about the processors supported by different machine types, see [Machine family comparison](/compute/docs/machine-types#machine_type_comparison) .\n- Try to [change the machine type](/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#changing_a_machine_type) by using the Google Cloud CLI.\n- If you switch from an x86 machine type to an Arm T2A machine type, you might receive a `INVALID_RESOURCE_USAGE' error indicating that your disk type is not compatible with an Arm machine type. Create a new T2A Arm instance using a compatible Arm OS and disk.## What's next?\n- To learn more about the Arm platform, see [Arm VMs on Compute](/compute/docs/instances/arm-on-compute) .\n- To learn about the T2A machine series, see [Tau T2A machine series](/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#t2a_machines) .\n- For troubleshooting NVMe issues, see [Troubleshooting NVMe disks](/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-disk-nvme) .", "guide": "Compute Engine"}
