{"title": "Cloud Architecture Center - Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) user provisioning and single sign-on", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview", "abstract": "# Cloud Architecture Center - Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) user provisioning and single sign-on\nThis document shows you how to set up user provisioning and single sign-on between a [Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) tenant and your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account.\nThe document assumes that you already use Microsoft Office 365 or Microsoft Entra ID in your organization and want to use Microsoft Entra ID for allowing users to authenticate with Google Cloud. Microsoft Entra ID itself might be connected to an on-premises Active Directory and might use AD FS federation, pass-through authentication, or password hash synchronization.\n **Note:** This article uses [classic organizational SSO profiles](/architecture/identity/single-sign-on#configuration) instead of SAML profiles to set up single sign-on. Organizational SSO profiles let you [choose whether to apply additional authentication challenges](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6002699#ssochallenges) to users, which is not supported for SAML profiles.", "content": "## Objectives\n- Set up Microsoft Entra ID to automatically provision users and, optionally, groups to Cloud Identity or Google Workspace.\n- Configure single sign-on to allow users to sign in to Google Cloud by using a Microsoft Entra ID user account or a user that has been provisioned from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID.\n## CostsIf you are using the [free edition of Cloud Identity](https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/7431902) , setting up federation with Microsoft Entra ID won't use any billable components of Google Cloud.\nCheck the [Microsoft Entra ID pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/) for any fees that might apply to using Microsoft Entra ID.## Before you begin\n- Make sure you understand the differences between [connecting Google Cloud to Microsoft Entra ID versus directly connecting Google Cloud to Active Directory](/solutions/federating-gcp-with-active-directory-introduction) .\n- Decide how you want to map [identities](/architecture/identity/federating-gcp-with-azure-active-directory#mapping_users) , [groups](/architecture/identity/federating-gcp-with-azure-active-directory#mapping_groups) , and [domains](/architecture/identity/federating-gcp-with-azure-active-directory#mapping_dns_domains) between Microsoft Entra ID and Cloud Identity or Google Workspace. Specifically, answer the following questions:- Do you plan to use email addresses or User Principal Names (UPNs) as common identifiers for users?\n- Do you plan to provision groups? If so, do you plan to map groups by email address or by name?\n- Do you plan to provision all users to Google Cloud or only a select subset of users?\n- Before connecting your production Microsoft Entra ID tenant to Google Cloud, consider using a Microsoft Entra ID test tenant for setting up and testing user provisioning.\n- [Sign up for Cloud Identity](https://workspace.google.com/signup/gcpidentity/welcome?&_ga=2.104797888.-157260409.1512652371) if you don't have an account already.\n- If you're using the [free edition of Cloud Identity](https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/7431902) and intend to provision more than 50 users, [request an increase](https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/7295541) of the total number of free Cloud Identity users through your support contact.\n- If you suspect that any of the domains you plan to use for Cloud Identity could have been used by employees to register consumer accounts, consider migrating these user accounts first. For more details, see [Assessing existing user accounts](/architecture/identity/assessing-existing-user-accounts) .\n **Note:** This document refers to the [Google Cloud/G Suite Connector by Microsoft gallery app from the Microsoft Azure marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/aad.googleapps) . This app is a Microsoft product and is not maintained or supported by Google.## Preparing your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account\n### Create a user for Microsoft Entra IDTo let Microsoft Entra ID access your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account, you must create a user for Microsoft Entra ID in your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account.\nThe Microsoft Entra ID user is only intended for automated provisioning. Therefore, it's best to keep it separate from other user accounts by placing it in a separate organizational unit (OU). Using a separate OU also ensures that you can later [disable single sign-on](/architecture/identity/best-practices-for-federating#disable_sso_for_super-admin_users) for the Microsoft Entra ID user.\nTo create a new OU, do the following:- Open the [Admin Console](https://admin.google.com) and log in using the super-admin user created when you signed up for Cloud Identity or Google Workspace.\n- In the menu, go to **Directory\u00a0> Organizational units** .\n- Click **Create organizational unit** and provide an name and description for the OU:- **Name** :`Automation`\n- **Description** :`Automation users`\n- Click **Create** .\nCreate a user account for Microsoft Entra ID and place it in the `Automation` OU:- In the menu, go to **Directory\u00a0> Users** and click **Add new user** to create a user.\n- Provide an appropriate name and email address such as the following:- **First Name** :`Microsoft Entra ID`\n- **Last Name** :`Provisioning`\n- **Primary email** : `azuread-provisioning`Keep the primary domain for the email address.\n- Click **Manage user's password, organizational unit, and profile photo** and configure the following settings:- **Organizational unit** : Select the`Automation`OU that you created previously.\n- **Password** : Select **Create password** and enter a password.\n- **Ask for a password change at the next sign-in** : **Disabled** .\n- Click **Add new user** .\n- Click **Done** .\n### Assign privileges to Microsoft Entra IDTo let Microsoft Entra ID create, list, and suspend users and groups in your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account, you must grant the `azuread-provisioning` user additional privileges as follows:- To allow Microsoft Entra ID to manage all users, including [delegated administrators](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9807615) and [super-admin users](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2405986) , you must make the `azuread-provisioning` user a super-admin.\n- To allow Microsoft Entra ID to manage non-admin users only, it's sufficient to make the `azuread-provisioning` user a delegated administrator. As a delegated administrator, Microsoft Entra ID can't manage other delegated administrators or super-admin users. **Note:** The super-admin role grants the user full access to Cloud Identity, Google Workspace, and Google Cloud resources.\nTo make the `azuread-provisioning` user a super-admin, do the following:- Locate the newly created user in the list and click the user's name to open their account page.\n- Under **Admin roles and privileges** , click **Assign roles** .\n- Enable the super-admin role.\n- Click **Save** .\nTo make the `azuread-provisioning` user a delegated administrator, create a new admin role and assign it to the user:- In the menu, go to **Account\u00a0> Admin roles** .\n- Click **Create new role** .\n- Provide a name and description for the role such as the following:- **Name** :`Microsoft Entra ID`\n- **Description** :`Role for automated user and group provisioning`\n- Click **Continue** .\n- On the next screen, scroll down to the section named **Admin API privileges** and set the following privileges to **enabled** :- **Organization Units\u00a0> Read** \n- **Users** \n- **Groups** \n- Click **Continue** .\n- Click **Create role** .\n- Click **Assign users** .\n- Select the`azuread-provisioning`user and click **Assign role** . **Warning:** To protect the user against credential theft and malicious use, we recommend that you enable [2-step verification](https://support.google.com/a/answer/175197) for the user. For more details on how to protect super-admin users, see [Security best practices for administrator accounts](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9011373) .\n### Register domainsIn Cloud Identity and Google Workspace, users and groups are identified by email address. The domains used by these email addresses must be registered and verified first.\nPrepare a list of DNS domains that you need to register:- If you plan to map users by UPN, include all domains used by UPNs. If in doubt, include all custom domains of your Microsoft Entra ID tenant.\n- If you plan to map users by email address, include all domains used in email addresses. The list of domains might be different from the list of custom domains of your Microsoft Entra ID tenant.\nIf you plan to provision groups, amend the list of DNS domains:- If you plan to map groups by email address, include all domains used in group email addresses. If in doubt, include all custom domains of your Microsoft Entra ID tenant.\n- If you plan to map groups by name, include a dedicated subdomain like`groups.` ``, where``is the primary domain name of your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account.\nNow that you've identified the list of DNS domains, you can register any missing domains. For each domain on the list not yet registered, perform the following steps:- In the Admin Console, go to **Account\u00a0> Domains\u00a0> Manage domains** .\n- Click **Add/remove domains** .\n- Click **Add a domain** .\n- Enter the domain name and select **Secondary domain** .\n- Click **Add domain and start verification** and follow the instructions to verify ownership of the domain.\n## Configuring Microsoft Entra ID provisioning\n### Create an enterprise applicationYou are now ready to connect Microsoft Entra ID to your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account by setting up the [Google Cloud/G Suite Connector by Microsoft gallery app from the Microsoft Azure marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/aad.googleapps) .\n **Note:** This app is a Microsoft product and is not maintained or supported by Google.\nThe gallery app can be configured to handle both user provisioning and single sign-on. In this document, you use two instances of the gallery app\u2014one for user provisioning and one for single sign-on.\nFirst, create an instance of the gallery app to handle user provisioning:- Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as a user withprivileges.\n- Select **Microsoft Entra ID\u00a0> Enterprise applications** .\n- Click **New application** .\n- Search for **Google Cloud** , and then click the **Google Cloud/G Suite Connector by Microsoft** item in the result list.\n- Set the name of the application to`Google Cloud (Provisioning)`.\n- Click **Create** .\n- Adding the application may take a few seconds, you should then be redirected to a page titled **Google Cloud (Provisioning) - Overview** .\n- In the menu on the left, click **Manage\u00a0> Properties** :- Set **Enabled for users to sign-in** to **No** .\n- Set **User assignment required** to **No** .\n- Set **Visible to users** to **No** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- In the menu on the left, click **Manage\u00a0> Provisioning** :- Click **Get started** .\n- Change **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic** .\n- Click **Admin Credentials\u00a0> Authorize** .\n- Sign in using the`azuread-provisioning@` ``user you created earlier, where``is the primary domain of your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account.\n- Because this is the first time you've signed on using this user, you are asked to accept the Google Terms of Service and privacy policy.\n- If you agree to the terms, click **I understand** .\n- Confirm access to the Cloud Identity API by clicking **Allow** .\n- Click **Test Connection** to verify that Microsoft Entra ID can successfully authenticate with Cloud Identity or Google Workspace.\n- Click **Save** .\n### Configure user provisioningThe right way to configure user provisioning depends on whether you intend to map users by email address or by UPN.\n- Under **Mappings** , click **Provision Azure Active Directory Users** .\n- Under **Attribute Mappings** , select the row **surname** and set **Default value if null** to`_`.\n- Select the row **givenName** and set **Default value if null** to`_`.\n- Click **OK** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- Confirm that saving changes will result in users and groups being resynchronized by clicking **Yes** .\n- Click **X** to close the **Attribute Mapping** dialog.\n- Under **Mappings** , click **Provision Azure Active Directory Users** .\n- Under **Attribute Mapping** , select the row **userPrincipalName** and configure the following mapping:- **Mapping type** : **Expression** \n- **Expression** :```\nReplace([userPrincipalName], \"@DOMAIN\", , , \"@SUBSTITUTE_DOMAIN\", , )\n```\nReplace the following:- ``: domain name you want to replace\n- ``domain name to use instead\n- Click **OK** .\n- Select the row **surname** and set **Default value if null** to `_` .\n- Select the row **givenName** and set **Default value if null** to `_` .\n- Click **OK** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- Confirm that saving changes will result in users and groups being resynchronized by clicking **Yes** .\n- Click **X** to close the **Attribute Mapping** dialog.\n- Under **Mappings** , click **Provision Azure Active Directory Users** .\n- Under **Attribute Mapping** , select the row **userPrincipalName** and set **Source Attribute** to **mail** .\n- Select the row **surname** and set **Default value if null** to`_`.\n- Select the row **givenName** and set **Default value if null** to`_`.\n- Click **OK** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- Confirm that saving changes will result in users and groups being resynchronized by clicking **Yes** .\n- Click **X** to close the **Attribute Mapping** dialog.\nYou must configure mappings for `primaryEmail` , `name.familyName` , `name.givenName` , and `suspended` . All other attribute mappings are optional.\nWhen you configure additional attribute mappings, note the following:- Thegallery currently doesn't let you assign [email aliases](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6304345) .\n- Thegallery currently doesn't let you assign licenses to users. As a workaround, consider setting up [automatic licensing for organizational units](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6342682) .\n- To assign a user to an organization unit, add a mapping for`OrgUnitPath`. The path must begin with a`/`character and must refer to an organizational unit that already exists, for example`/employees/engineering`.\n### Configure group provisioningThe right way to configure group provisioning depends on whether your groups are mail-enabled. If groups aren't mail-enabled, or if groups use an email address ending with \"onmicrosoft.com\", you can derive an email address from the group's name.\n- Under **Mappings** , click **Provision Azure Active Directory Groups** .\n- Set **Enabled** to **No** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- Confirm that saving changes will result in users and groups being resynchronized by clicking **Yes** .\n- Click **X** to close the **Attribute Mapping** dialog.\n- Under **Mappings** section, click **Provision Azure Active Directory Groups** .\n- In the **Attribute Mappings** section, click **mail** , which opens the **Edit Attribute** dialog.\n- Configure the following settings:- **Mapping type** : **Expression** .\n- **Expression** :`Join(\"@\", NormalizeDiacritics(StripSpaces([displayName])), \"` `` `\")`. Replace``with the domain that all group email addresses are supposed to use\u2014for example,`groups.example.com`.\n- **Target attribute** : **email** .\n- Click **OK** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- Confirm that saving changes will result in users and groups being resynchronized by clicking **Yes** .\n- Click **X** to close the **Attribute Mapping** dialog.\n- If you map groups by email address, keep the default settings.### Configure user assignmentIf you know that only a [certain subset of users need access to Google Cloud](/architecture/identity/federating-gcp-with-azure-active-directory#onboarding) , you can optionally restrict the set of users to be provisioned by [assigning the enterprise app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal) to specific users or groups of users.\nIf you want all users to be provisioned, you can skip the following steps.- In the menu on the left, click **Manage\u00a0> Users and groups** .\n- Click **Add user** .\n- Select **Users** .\n- Select the users or groups you want to provision. If you select a group, all members of this group are automatically provisioned.\n- Click **Select** .\n- Click **Assign** .\n### Enable automatic provisioningThe next step is to configure Microsoft Entra ID to automatically provision users to Cloud Identity or Google Workspace:- In the menu on the left, click **Manage\u00a0> Provisioning** .\n- Select **Edit provisioning** .\n- Set **Provisioning Status** to **On** .\n- Under **Settings** , set **Scope** to one of the following:- **Sync only assigned users and groups** if you have configured user assignment.\n- **Sync all users and groups** otherwise.\nIf this box to set the scope isn't displayed, click **Save** and refresh the page.\n- Click **Save** .\nMicrosoft Entra ID starts an initial synchronization. Depending on the number of users and groups in the directory, this process can take several minutes or hours. You can refresh the browser page to see the status of the synchronization at the bottom of the page or select **Audit Logs** in the menu to see more details.\nAfter the initial synchronization has completed, Microsoft Entra ID will periodically propagate updates from Microsoft Entra ID to your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account. For further details on how Microsoft Entra ID handles user and group modifications, see [Mapping the user lifecycle](/architecture/identity/federating-gcp-with-azure-active-directory#mapping_the_user_lifecycle) and [Mapping the group lifecycle](/architecture/identity/federating-gcp-with-azure-active-directory#mapping_the_group_lifecycle) .\n### TroubleshootingIf the synchronization doesn't start within five minutes, you can force it to start by doing the following:- Set **Provisioning Status** to **Off** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- Set **Provisioning Status** to **On** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- Check **Restart provisioning** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- Confirm restarting the synchronization by clicking **Yes** .\nIf synchronization still doesn't start, click **Test Connection** to verify that your credentials have been saved successfully.## Configuring Microsoft Entra ID for single sign-onAlthough all relevant Microsoft Entra ID users are now automatically being provisioned to Cloud Identity or Google Workspace, you cannot use these users to sign in yet. To allow users to sign in, you still need to configure single sign-on.\n### Create an enterprise applicationCreate a second enterprise application to handle single sign-on:- In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) , go to **Microsoft Entra ID\u00a0> Enterprise applications** .\n- Click **New application** .\n- Search for **Google Cloud** , and then click **Google Cloud/G Suite Connector by Microsoft** in the result list.\n- Set the name of the application to`Google Cloud`.\n- Click **Add** .Adding the application may take a few seconds. You are then redirected to a page titled **Google Cloud - Overview** .\n- In the menu on the left, click **Manage\u00a0> Properties** .\n- Set **Enabled for users to sign-in** to **Yes** .\n- Set **User assignment required** to **Yes** unless you want to allow all users to use single sign-on.\n- Click **Save** .\n### Configure user assignmentIf you already know that only a [certain subset of users need access to Google Cloud](/architecture/identity/federating-gcp-with-azure-active-directory#onboarding) , you can optionally restrict the set of users to be allowed to sign in by [assigning the enterprise app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal) to specific users or groups of users.\nIf you set **User assignment required** to **No** before, then you can skip the following steps.- In the menu on the left, click **Manage\u00a0> Users and groups** .\n- Click **Add user** .\n- Select **Users and groups/None Selected** .\n- Select the users or groups you want to allow single sign-on for.\n- Click **Select** .\n- Click **Assign** .\n### Configure SAML settingsTo enable Cloud Identity to use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, you must adjust some settings:- In the menu on the left, click **Manage\u00a0> Single sign-on** .\n- On the ballot screen, click the **SAML** card.\n- On the **Basic SAML Configuration** card, click **Edit** .\n- In the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog, enter the following settings:- **Identifier (Entity ID)** :`google.com`\n- **Reply URL** :`https://www.google.com/`\n- **Sign on URL** :`https://www.google.com/a/` `` `/ServiceLogin?continue=https://console.cloud.google.com/`, replacing``with the primary domain name used by your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account.\n- Click **Save** , and then dismiss the dialog by clicking **X** .\n- On the **SAML Signing Certificate** card, find the entry labeled **Certificate (Base 64)** and click **Download** to download the certificate to your local computer.\n- On the **Set up Google Cloud** card, look for **Login URL** . You need this URL shortly.\nThe remaining steps differ depending on whether you map users by email address or by UPN.\n- On the **Attributes & Claims** card, click **Edit** .\n- Delete all claims listed under **Additional claims** . You can delete records by clicking the **\u2026** button and selecting **Delete** .The list of attributes and claims now looks like the following: \n- Dismiss the dialog by clicking **X** .\n- On the **User Attributes & Claims** card, click **Edit** .\n- Delete all claims listed under **Additional claims** . You can delete records by clicking the **\u2026** button and selecting **Delete** .The list of attributes and claims now looks like the following: \n- Click **Unique User Identifier (Name ID)** to change the claims mapping.\n- Set **Source** to **Transformation** and configure the following transformation:- **Transformation** : **ExtractMailPrefix()** \n- **Parameter 1** : **user.userPrincipalName** \n- Select **Add transformation** and configure the following transformation:- **Transformation** : **Join()** \n- **Separator** :`@`\n- **Parameter 2** : Enter the substitute domain name.\nYou must use the same substitute domain name for user provisioning and single sign-on. If the domain name isn't listed, you might need to [verify it first ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/domains-manage#add-custom-domain-names-to-your-azure-ad-organization) .\n- Click **Add** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- Dismiss the dialog by clicking **X** .\n- On the **User Attributes & Claims** card, click **Edit** .\n- Select the row labeled **Unique User Identifier (Name ID)** .\n- Change **Source attribute** to **user.mail** .\n- Click **Save** .\n- Delete all claims listed under **Additional claims** . To delete all records, click , and then click **Delete** . \n- Dismiss the dialog by clicking .\n## Configuring Cloud Identity or Google Workspace for single sign-onNow that you've prepared Microsoft Entra ID for single sign-on, you can enable single sign-on in your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account:- Open the [Admin Console](https://admin.google.com) and log in using a super-admin user.\n- In the menu, click **Show more** and go to **Security\u00a0> Authentication\u00a0> SSO with third-party IdP** .\n- Click **Add SSO profile** . **Note:** Don't use the **Add SAML profile** button.\n- Set **Setup SSO with third party identity provider** to **enabled** .\n- Enter the following settings:- **Sign-in page URL** : Enter the Microsoft Entra ID Login URL. The Login URL is on the **Set up Google Cloud** card in the Azure Portal under **Configuration URLs\u00a0> Login URL** .\n- **Sign-out page URL** :`https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/wsfederation?wa=wsignout1.0`\n- **Change password URL** :`https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/changepassword.aspx`\n- Under **Verification certificate** , click **Upload certificate** , and then pick the token signing certificate that you downloaded previously.\n- Click **Save** .\nUpdate the SSO settings for the `Automation` OU to [disable single sign-on](/architecture/identity/best-practices-for-federating#disable_sso_for_super-admin_users) :- Under **Manage SSO profile assignments** , click **Get started** .\n- Expand **Organizational units** and select the`Automation`OU.\n- Change the SSO profile assignment from **Organization's third-party SSO profile** to **None** .\n- Click **Override** .\nThe Microsoft Entra ID token signing certification is valid only for several months. You must rotate the certificate before it expires. For more information, see [Rotate a single sign-on certificate](#rotating) later in this document.\nConsider configuring Microsoft Entra ID to [send you notification emails](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on#add-email-notification-addresses-for-certificate-expiration) ahead of certificate expiration to avoid certificate expiration from impacting users.## Test single sign-onNow that you've completed the single sign-on configuration in both Microsoft Entra ID and Cloud Identity or Google Workspace, you can access Google Cloud in two ways:- Through the list of apps in your [Microsoft Office portal](https://www.office.com/) .\n- Directly by opening [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/) .\nTo check that the second option works as intended, run the following test:- Pick a Microsoft Entra ID user that has been provisioned to Cloud Identity or Google Workspace and that doesn't have super-admin privileges assigned. Users with super-admin privileges always have to sign in using Google credentials and are therefore not suitable for testing single sign-on.\n- Open a new browser window and go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/) .\n- In the Google Sign-In page that appears, enter the email address of the user and click **Next** . If you use domain substitution, this address must be the email address with the substitution applied. \n- You are redirected to Microsoft Entra ID and will see another sign-in prompt. Enter the email address of the user (without domain substitution) and click **Next** . \n- After entering your password, you are prompted whether to stay signed in or not. For now, choose **No** .After successful authentication, Microsoft Entra ID should redirect you back to Google Sign-In. Because this is the first time you've signed in using this user, you are asked to accept the Google Terms of Service and privacy policy.\n- If you agree to the terms, click **I understand** .You are redirected to the Google Cloud console, which asks you to confirm preferences and accept the Google Cloud Terms of Service.\n- If you agree to the terms, choose **Yes** and click **Agree and continue** .\n- Click the avatar icon on the top left of the page, and then click **Sign out** .You are redirected to a Microsoft Entra ID page confirming that you have been successfully signed out.\nKeep in mind that users with super-admin privileges are exempted from single sign-on, so you can still use the Admin Console to verify or change settings.## Rotate a single sign-on certificateThe Microsoft Entra ID token signing certificate is valid for only several months, and you must replace the certificate before it expires.\nTo rotate a signing certificate, add an additional certificate to the Microsoft Entra ID application:- In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) , go to **Microsoft Entra ID\u00a0> Enterprise applications** and open the application that you created for single sign-on.\n- In the menu on the left, click **Manage\u00a0> Single sign-on** .\n- On the **SAML Signing Certificate** card, click **Edit** .You see a list of one or more certificates. One certificate is marked as **Active** .\n- Click **New certificate** .\n- Keep the default signing settings and click **Save** .The certificate is added to the list of certificates and is marked as **Inactive** .\n- Select the new certificate and click **more_horiz\u00a0> Base64 certificate download** .Keep the browser window open and don't close the dialog.\nTo use the new certificate, do the following:- Open a new browser tab or window.\n- Open the [Admin Console](https://admin.google.com) and log in using a super-admin user.\n- In the menu, click **Show more** and go to **Security\u00a0> Authentication\u00a0> SSO with third-party IdP** .\n- Click **SSO profile for your organization** .\n- Click **Replace certificate** and select the new certificate that you downloaded previously. **Caution:** After you save changes, your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account no longer accepts the old Microsoft Entra ID signing certificate.\n- Click **Save** .\n- Return to the Microsoft Entra ID portal and the **SAML Signing Certificate** dialog.\n- Select the new certificate and click **more_horiz\u00a0> Make certificate active** .\n- Click **Yes** to activate the certificate.Microsoft Entra ID now uses the new signing certificate.\n- Test that SSO still works as expected. For more information, see [Test single sign-on](#testing) .\n## Clean upTo avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this   tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and   delete the individual resources.\nTo disable single sign-on in your Cloud Identity or Google Workspace account, follow these steps:- Open the [Admin Console](https://admin.google.com) and log in using the super-admin user created when signing up for Cloud Identity or Google Workspace.\n- In the menu, go to **Security\u00a0> Settings** .\n- Click **Set up single sign-on (SSO) with a third party IdP** .\n- Ensure that **Set up SSO with third party identity provider** is disabled.\nYou can remove single sign-on and provisioning settings in Microsoft Entra ID as follows:- In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) , go to **Microsoft Entra ID\u00a0> Enterprise applications** .\n- From the list of applications, choose **Google Cloud** .\n- In the menu on the left, click **Manage\u00a0> Single sign-on** .\n- Click **Delete** .\n- Confirm the deletion by clicking **Yes** .\n## What's next\n- Learn more about [federating Google Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID](/architecture/identity/federating-gcp-with-azure-active-directory) \n- Read about [best practices for planning accounts and organizations](/architecture/identity/best-practices-for-planning) and [best practices for federating Google Cloud with an external identity provider](/architecture/identity/best-practices-for-federating) .\n- Acquaint yourself with our [best practices for managing super-admin accounts.](/resource-manager/docs/super-admin-best-practices)", "guide": "Cloud Architecture Center"}
