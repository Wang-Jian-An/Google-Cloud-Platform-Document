The issue only occurred under certain circumstances. For example: a) For requests not requiring authn/z check, no authContext was generated and dynamic metadata was nil causing the access log entry to be ignored. b) The denied response used RPC code instead of HTTP code, causing records to be shown in the Apigee UI as success. |", "guide": "Apigee"}
