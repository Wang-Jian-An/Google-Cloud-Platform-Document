For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\nTo ensure the integrity of all runtime container images published and downloaded for production systems, image signing support is now available for all Apigee hybrid images using Docker Hub. All hybrid runtime images are publicly available for download from the [ Google Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/google) account.\nHybrid images are signed with [ Docker Content Trust](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/) , a feature that lets users verify the integrity and publisher of every image built and running in a Docker registry. These signatures allow client-side or runtime verification of specific image tags against publisher keys, ensuring that the image is exactly what the publisher created and pushed for publication.\n", "content": "## Download signed container images\nIf you are using a Kubernetes cluster without internet access to deploy your hybrid runtime services, you will need to download the container images to a local container registry and then access the registry from your Kubernetes cluster.\nTo download a signed container image, you should have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) installed and use the `docker pull` command as follows. Be sure to append the correct tag to each image name. For example, the tag for `apigee-synchronizer` is `1.1.1` , as shown below.\n```\ndocker pull google/apigee-mart-server:1.1.1\ndocker pull google/apigee-synchronizer:1.1.1\ndocker pull google/apigee-runtime:1.1.1\ndocker pull google/apigee-authn-authz:1.1.1\ndocker pull google/apigee-cassandra-client:1.1.1\ndocker pull google/apigee-cassandra-backup-utility:1.1.1\ndocker pull google/apigee-cassandra:1.1.1\ndocker pull google/apigee-udca:1.1.1\ndocker pull google/apigee-stackdriver-logging-agent:1.6.8\ndocker pull google/apigee-prom-prometheus:v2.9.2\ndocker pull google/apigee-stackdriver-prometheus-sidecar:release-0.4.0\ndocker pull google/busybox:1.30.1\n```\n## Verify container image signer and signatures\nTo verify that an image has been signed, run the following command:\n```\ndocker trust inspect --pretty $IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG\n```\nThe output of this command will let you know whether the tagged image is signed, the name of the signers, and a list of signers and keys. For example:\n```\ndocker trust inspect --pretty google/apigee-mart-server:1.1.1\nSignatures for google/apigee-mart-server:1.1.1SIGNED TAG \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0DIGEST \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 SIGNERSbeta2a607b0e7acba41544e5db8e74b039e9314fdcfdc6f1acf73094d3179fc2af322 \u00a0 asf-adminList of signers and their keys for google/apigee-mart-server:1.1.1SIGNER \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0KEYSasf-admin \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 7d4abdbb7bfdAdministrative keys for google/apigee-mart-server:1.1.1Repository Key: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 80f86b047965f6dec0c056b1938a7f8cfb894ba8014fba36a18d0923173d394aRoot Key: \u00a0 \u00a0 6f2d60f90a0d78dd6254d3d47613a4dd6eb0880f83411e6f8b122b84dbef69ca\n```", "guide": "Apigee"}
