That commitment extends to Google Cloud generative AI products. Google helps ensure that its teams are following these commitments through robust data governance practices, which includes reviews of the data that Google Cloud uses in the development of its products. More details about how Google processes data can also be found in [Google's Customer Data Processing Addendum (CDPA)](/terms/data-processing-addendum) .\n", "content": "## Usage of generative AI\nVertex AI Search and Conversation uses generative AI services for building search, personalized, and conversational experiences.\nAs part of the Google Cloud AI/ML Privacy Commitment, customer data used in Vertex AI Search and Conversation is not used to train foundation models.\nFoundation models are frozen and only process input to provide output for the services provided by Vertex AI Search and Conversation.\n## Customer-specific models\nWhen applicable, customer-specific models are built automatically and used only in the context of the project that is specific to the customer for the Vertex AI Search and Conversation service.\nAny customer data used to create these customer-specific models is not used to train foundation models.\nCustomer-specific models, much like all customer data, continues to be protected by [Google's security controls and best practices](/docs/security/overview/whitepaper) .", "guide": "Vertex AI Search and Conversation"}
