Pre-GA products and features may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA products and features may not be compatible with other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) . Further, by using this feature, you agree to the [Generative AI Preview terms and conditions](https://cloud.google.com/trustedtester/aitos) (\"Preview Terms\"). For this feature, you can process personal data as outlined in the [Cloud Data Processing Addendum](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms) , subject to applicable restrictions and obligations in the Agreement (as defined in the Preview Terms).\n## An easy experience to get started\nVertex AI Search makes it easy to get started with high-quality search or recommendations based on data that you provide. As part of the setup experience, you can:\n- Use your existing Google Account or sign up for one.\n- Use your existing Google Cloud project or create one.\n- Create an app and attach a data store to it. Provide data to search or recommend by entering the URLs for your website content, importing your data from BigQuery or Cloud Storage, or importing FHIR R4 data from Cloud Healthcare API, or uploading through RESTful CRUD APIs. Syncing data from Jira, Salesforce, or Confluence is available in Preview with allowlist.\n- Embed JavaScript widgets and API samples to integrate search or recommendations into your website or applications.## Data stores and apps\nWith Vertex AI Search, you create a search or recommendations app and attach it to a data store. You import your data into a data store and index your data. Apps and data stores have a one-to-one relationship.\nThere are various kinds of data stores that you can create, based on the type of data you use. Each data store can contain one type of data:\n- **Website data** : You can provide domains such as`yourexamplewebsite.com/faq`and`yourexamplewebsite.com/events`and enable search or recommendations over the content at those domains.\n- **Structured data** : A data store with structured data enables semantic search or recommendations over structured data such as a BigQuery table or NDJSON files. For example, you can enable search or recommendations over a product catalog for your ecommerce experience, a movie catalog for movie search or recommendations, or a directory of doctors for provider search or recommendations.\n- **Unstructured data** : An unstructured data store enables semantic search or recommendations over data such as documents and images. For example, a financial institution can enable search or recommendations over their private corpus of financial research publications, or a biotech company can enable search or recommendations over their private repository of medical research.\n- **Healthcare data** : A healthcare data store enables semantic search over healthcare FHIR R4 data imported from Cloud Healthcare API. For example, a healthcare provider can search over a patient's clinical history using exploratory queries.\nFor more information, see [About apps and data stores](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-datastore-ingest) .\n## Google Cloud console or the API?\nYou can implement Vertex AI Search in any of the following ways:\n- **Use the Google Cloud console.** Use the [Search and Conversation](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/engines) page of the console for a quick-start experience using a web interface. From the console, you can create your search app, import your data, test the user experience, and view analytics.\n- **Use the Vertex AI Search and Conversation API.** Use the Vertex AI Search and Conversation API when you're ready to integrate search or recommendations into your website or applications.\n- **Use both the Google Cloud console and the API.** You can set up your app and import your data using the console, for example, and then use the API to test the user experience and integrate it into your website or application.## What's next\n- [About apps and data stores](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-datastore-ingest) \n- [Get started with generic search](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/try-enterprise-search) \n- [Get started with Recommendations](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/try-personalize)", "guide": "Vertex AI Search and Conversation"}
