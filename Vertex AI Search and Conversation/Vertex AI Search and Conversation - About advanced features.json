This requires [domainverification](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/domain-verification) and imposes a quota on the number of pages that you can index. You can [upgrade this quota](/generative-ai-app-builder/quotas#request-a-quota-increase) if necessary. Advanced website indexing incurs additional cost.

This means that you cannot turn on advanced website indexing for an existing data store. Instead, you must create a new data store and turn on Advanced website indexing when creating that data store. Also, you cannot turn off Advanced website indexing for an existing data store. Instead, you must create a new data store, leaving the **advanced website indexing** toggle in the off position.", "guide": "Vertex AI Search and Conversation"}
