A serving config contains configurations that are used when generating your media recommendations results.\n", "content": "## About serving configs\nServing configs are referenced at serving time to determine what recommendations to generate.\nWhen any Vertex AI Search app is created, a default serving config is also automatically created. For search apps, the default serving config's ID is `default_search` . For recommendations apps, the serving config's ID is the same as the engine ID. The default serving config ID is specified when making `recommend` or `search` API calls.\nHowever, search and generic recommendations apps don't allow you to modify serving configs or create additional serving configs. Only media recommendation apps have modifiable serving configs and allow multiple serving configs.\nFor any media recommendation app, you can create multiple serving configs with different settings for recommendations demotion and recommendations diversity. To get recommendations from a specific serving config with the demotion and diversity settings you need, specify that serving config's ID in the `recommend` request.\n## Serving config settings\nThe following settings are available for serving configs:\n- **Recommendation demotion** . You can demote media recommendations based on viewer data or content age. For information about demotion settings and how to set them, see [Demote media recommendations](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/demote-recommendations) .\n- **Recommendation diversity** . You can diversify recommendations to reduce the likelihood that similar content is shown in a recommendation panel. For information about diversification settings and how to set them, see [Diversify media recommendations](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/diversify-recommendations) .## Create a serving config\nTo create a serving config, follow these steps:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page.
