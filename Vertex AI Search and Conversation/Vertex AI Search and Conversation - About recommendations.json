However, there are some differences between them. These differences are outlined in the following table:\n| Media recommendations                                   | Generic recommendations                        |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Data stores are always structured.                                | Data stores can be of any type (website, unstructured, structured).             |\n| Requires structured data with a predefined schema.                            | Schemas are optional for structured data.                    |\n| You can create a data store only at the end of the app creation workflow.                      | You can create a data store independently of creating an app.               |\n| You can't create an app without connecting a data store to it.                         | You can create an app or a data store in any order and connect them later.           |\n| You must create and connect at least one data store at the end of the app creation workflow. You can create and connect multiple data stores to the app later. | You can create an app without any data store.                   |\n| You can create empty data stores and add data to them later.                         | You cannot create an empty data store. You must import data into a data store during the data store creation process. |\n| You can connect multiple apps to a single data store.                           | You must connect only one app to a data store.                  |\n| Data store contains documents and user events.                             | Data store contains documents.                      |\n| Imported historical user events are joined synchronously.                          | Imported historical user events are joined asynchronously.               |\nFor more information about the topics from the preceding table, see:\n- [Create a media app and a data store](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-app-data-store-media-recommendations) \n- [Import data into a media recommendations data store](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/import-data-media-recommendations) \n- [Create a generic recommendations data store](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-data-store-recommendations) \n- [Create a generic recommendations app](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-engine-personalize) \n- [Import historical user events](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/import-user-events) \n- [JSON Schema for Document](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/media-documents#json-schema)", "guide": "Vertex AI Search and Conversation"}
