To import user event data from past events, see [Import historical user events](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/import-user-events) .\n", "content": "## View aggregated user event information\nYou can see information about recorded user events for your app in the Google Cloud console on the **Events** tab of your app's **Data** page.\nThis page shows information such as number of events ingested, number of unjoined events, percentage change in number of events over a period, and average count of event type per document. In addition, you can see metrics for each event type over time. Metrics appear about 24 hours after you first upload events to Recommendations for Media.\nTo see your user event information:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page. [Search and Conversation](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/start) \n- Click the name of the app that you want to see user event information for.\n- On the **Data** page, go to the **Events** tab. User event information is displayed on this tab.## Remove user events\nTo remove user events, you must delete your app and its connected data store that contains the events. Deleting your app and data store also removes your documents. You might decide to remove user events if they were imported incorrectly and you want to re-import them.\nFor more information, see [Delete an app](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/delete-engine) .\n## Use the user event filter\nYou can filter user events to be deleted.\nThe filter is a string that contains one or more of the following restrictions:\n- `eventTime` : Provides a timestamp to bound the events to be deleted. This filter can be specified once or twice, with a greater-than ( `>` ) or less-than ( `<` ) symbol. The bounded time must be a single contiguous block.\n- `eventType` : Restrict the events to be deleted to a single event type.\n- `visitorID` : Restrict the events to be deleted to a single visitor ID.\n- `userID` : Restrict the events to be deleted to a single user ID.\nOnly user events that satisfy all of the restrictions are deleted.\nFor example, to delete all user events of type `add-to-cart` that were logged on or after February 1, 2023, you would provide the following filter string:\n```\neventTime > \"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z\" eventType = add-to-cart\n```\n## What's next\n- [Record real-time user events](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/record-user-events) \n- [Import historical user events](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/import-user-events) .", "guide": "Vertex AI Search and Conversation"}
