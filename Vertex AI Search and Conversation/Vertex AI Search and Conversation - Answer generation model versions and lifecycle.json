You can choose the model versions when using [searchsummaries](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/get-search-summaries) and [search withfollow-ups](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/multi-turn-search) .\n", "content": "## Generally available (GA) models\nVertex AI Search uses two types of GA models for question and answering use cases:\n- Vertex AI LLM models that have been tested on question and answering tasks\n- Vertex AI Search models that based on Vertex AI LLM models and further trained to address question and answering tasks\nVertex AI Search models share the same discontinuation date as their base Vertex AI LLM models. The base LLM model is available for six months after the release date of the next version of the model, per the [VertexAI model lifecyclepolicy](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versioning) . Leave enough time to migrate to new models before the discontinuation dates.\nThe following table lists model version specifications. When you set a model specification, the API uses the specified model to generate answers.\n| Model version specification  | Description                                                                         | Context window | Discontinuation date                         |\n|:---------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| stable       | The default model choice if the model version is not set.
