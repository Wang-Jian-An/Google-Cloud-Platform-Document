If you turn on advanced website indexing when you create a data store, you have the opportunity to verify your domain ownership for the websites you are indexing directly after creating the data store. If you don't verify your domain ownership, your website can't be indexed.\n", "content": "## Domain verification behavior\nBe aware of the following domain-verification behavior:\n- When you verify ownership of a domain, that domain is automatically verified for all data stores in that project. This persists even if in the future you are no longer the owner of the domain.\n- When you verify ownership of any part of a domain, you are verifying ownership of the entire domain. For example, if you verify ownership of www.mysite.com/abc and later add www.mysite.com/def to your data store, you won't need to verify ownership www.mysite.com/def. Because www.mysite.com/def is within the mysite.com domain, it is already verified.\nIf you encounter challenges verifying your domain ownership, contact your designated customer engineer or Google account team. After they have verified that your organization owns the specified domains, they will submit a domain-verification exemption request to unblock you.\n## Verify your domain ownership\nIf you created a data store, turned on advanced website indexing, but didn't verify your ownership of the websites in the data store, you can do so at any time.\nTo verify your domain ownership for websites in a data store with [advanced website indexing](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/about-advanced-features#advanced-website-indexing) , follow these steps:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page. [Search and Conversation](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/start) \n- In the navigation menu, click **Data stores** .\n- Click the name of the data store with websites for which you haven't yet verified your domain ownership.\n- In the navigation menu, make sure **Data** is selected.\n- Click **Verify in Google Search console** . The **Welcome to theGoogle Search Console** page appears.\n- Follow the on-screen instructions in the Google Search Console to verify a domain or a URL prefix, depending on whether you are verifying an entire domain or a URL prefix that is part of a domain. For more information, see [Verify your site ownership](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080) in the Search Console Help Center.When you have finished the domain verification workflow, the **Data** page for your data store appears.
