To deploy your app, you can use the [searchwidget](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/add-widget) by copying code from the Google Cloud console directly into a web page\u2014no coding required. Or you can implement a traditional API deployment to have control over how search functionality looks on your website. For more information about using the API, see the REST tab of [Get searchresults for an app with website data](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/preview-search-results#web) and the [servingConfigs.search](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.collections.dataStores.servingConfigs/search) method in the REST reference.\nIn additional to the standard short snippets that Vertex AI Search returns with search results, you can add advanced features to your search. These include generated [summaries](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/get-search-summaries) of search results, [searchwith follow-ups](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/multi-turn-search) for context-aware search that allows follow-up questions, and [extractive answers](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/snippets#extractive-answers) (Preview) for extracted text returned with each search result. Getting these advanced features for your web search requires [domain verification](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/domain-verification) and incurs additional indexing costs. For more information, see the [Vertex AI Search and Conversation pricing](/generative-ai-app-builder/pricing) page.\n", "content": "## Set up Vertex AI Search\nTo set up Vertex AI Search, follow these steps:\n- Get ready to create a search app:- In the Google Cloud console, on the [project selectorpage](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard) , select the project that you've been using for the Custom Search Site Restricted JSON API.\n- [Turn on Vertex AI Search and Conversation](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/before-you-begin#turn-on-discovery-engine) .\n- Create a search app:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page.
