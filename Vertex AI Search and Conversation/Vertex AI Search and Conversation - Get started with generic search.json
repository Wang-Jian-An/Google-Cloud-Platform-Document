Vertex AI Search also has special capabilities for some industries, such as media, healthcare, and retail.\nThis tutorial focuses on creating a search app for data; that is, data which are not specific to an industry vertical.\nThis tutorial explains how to create three search apps, each for a different kind of data:- Website content from crawling cloud.google.com\n- Structured data in the form of an NDJSON-formatted dataset ingested from a Cloud Storage bucket\n- Unstructured data in the form of PDFs ingested from a Cloud Storage bucket\nBefore following this tutorial, make sure you have done the steps in [Before youbegin](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/before-you-begin) .\n **Note:** This tutorial is for Vertex AI Search.
