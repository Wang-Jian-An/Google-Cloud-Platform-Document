For more information, see [About connecting multiple data stores](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-data-store-es#multi-data-stores) .\nTo use the Google Cloud console to create a search app, follow these steps:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page. [Search and Conversation](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/engines) \n- On the **Apps** page, click **New app** .\n- On the **Create app** page, select **Search** .\n- If you are offered a choice of generic or media content, click **Generic** .\n- Decide if you want Enterprise features for this app and then click the toggle on or off.Turning on Enterprise edition features is required to get features such as website search and choosing a region for your app. Enterprise edition features incur additional cost. For more information, see [Enterprise edition features](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/about-advanced-features#enterprise-features) .\n- Decide if you want Advanced LLM features for this app and then click the toggle on or off.Activating Advanced LLM features is required to get features such as [search summaries](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/get-search-summaries) or [search with follow-ups](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/multi-turn-search) . For more information, see [Advanced LLM features](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/about-advanced-features#advanced-llm-features) .\n- In the **Your app name** field, enter a name for your app.\n- In the **External name of your company or organization** field, enter the common name for your company or organization. You don't need to include suffixes such as Inc or LLC. This field is useful for the LLM to identify the company that the app represents.\n- Select a location for your app. Enterprise features must be turned on to pick a location. Google recommends that you use the default, **global(Global)** , unless you have a reason to restrict your data to a particular geography.\n- Click **Continue** .\n- Attach a data store to your app. You can select a data store that you previously created, or create a new data store. Do one of the following:- Select an existing data store. A data store can be attached to only one app, and it can't be removed from the app later.\n- Create a new data store and ingest data into it. Do this by clicking **Create new data store** and following the steps in the **Create a newdata store** pane that opens. Then select your new data store. For more information about creating a data store, see [Create a data store and ingest data for Vertex AI Search](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-data-store-es) .\n- Click **Create** .\nBefore you use the command line to create an app, you must have an existing data store. If you don't have a data store, create one following the steps in [Create a data store and ingest data for Vertex AI Search](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-data-store-es) .\nTo use the [engines.create](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.collections.engines/create) method to create a search app from the command line, follow these steps:- Find your data store ID. If you already have your data store ID, skip to the next step.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page and in the navigation menu, click **Data stores** . [Go to the Data stores page](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/data-stores) \n- Click the name of your data store.\n- On the **Data** page for your data store, get the data store ID.\n- Create an app of type \"engine\" that refers to the data store. A data store can be attached to only one app and can't be removed from the app later.```\ncurl -X POST \\-H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\-H \"X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID\" \\\"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines?engineId=DATA_STORE_ID\" \\-d '{\u00a0 \"displayName\": \"DISPLAY_NAME\",\u00a0 \"dataStoreIds\": [\"DATA_STORE_ID\"],\u00a0 \"solutionType\": \"SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH\",\u00a0 \"searchEngineConfig\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"searchTier\": \"SEARCH_TIER\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"searchAddOns\": [\"SEARCH_ADD_ON\"]\u00a0 \u00a0}}'\n```Replace the following:- ``: The ID of your project.\n- ``: The ID of the data store. Use the ID of the data store that you created in the previous step.\n- ``: The display name of the engine. This is displayed in the Google Cloud console.\n- ``: The search tier can be`SEARCH_TIER_STANDARD`or`SEARCH_TIER_ENTERPRISE`.`SEARCH_TIER_ENTERPRISE`is required to get features such as website search and choosing a region for your app. Enterprise edition features incur additional cost.
