Instead, media data stores must be created as part of the media app creation workflow.\nThe processes for [creating media recommendations apps](#recs) and [creatingmedia search apps](#search) are similar. Both apps can use the same data stores\u2014although for recommendations the data store must contain user events while for search, user events are recommended but not required.\n", "content": "## Create a media recommendations app and data store\nTo use the Google Cloud console to create a media recommendations app, follow these steps:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page.
