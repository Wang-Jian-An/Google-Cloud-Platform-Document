Training and tuning are not available for search or generic recommendations apps.\nMedia recommendations apps are automatically tuned every three months, and automatically trained at least once a week and at most once a day.\nYou can use these instructions to manually restart tuning for your app, or to pause and resume training.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\nBefore you can train or tune your app, you must meet the app's minimum data requirements.\nFor information about data requirements, see [Prepare data for ingesting](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/prepare-data#structured-media) .\n## Manually tune a media recommendations app\nMedia recommendations apps use the data you upload to adjust hyperparameters for training underlying models. They are automatically tuned every three months.\nTuning keeps training optimal as data and end user behavior change throughout the year. In addition, some internal upgrades can only be applied after the app has been tuned.\nFor information about tuning costs, see [Pricing](/generative-ai-app-builder/pricing) .\nManually restarting tuning triggers a one-time tune for your app. You might restart tuning for your app when there is a significant change in your data store (such as size increase or change in hierarchy) or events (such as backfilling historical events or a change in data distribution after promoting certain groups of content).\nTo restart tuning, follow these steps:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page. [Search and Conversation](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/start) \n- Click the name of the app that you plan to tune.\n- Go to the **Configurations** page and click the **Training** tab. This page shows the tuning status of your app.\n- Click **Restart tuning** .Tuning takes 2-4 days, during which the app continues to work as usual.## Pause and resume training for a model\nIf your app is active (not paused), training occurs at least once a week, but no more often than once a day. For consistent retraining, make sure that you upload user event data no more than 24 hours after the event occurs.\nYou can pause your model to stop retraining. You might want to do this if you have imported bad data or to stay under the limit of 10 active recommendation apps per project. If you have fewer than 10 active models, you can restart a paused app at any time.\nFor training cost details, see [Pricing](/generative-ai-app-builder/pricing) .\nYou can start up to five media app creation, deletion, pause training, and resume training operations per minute.\nTo pause or resume training:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page. [Search and Conversation](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/start) \n- Click the name of the app you plan to tune.\n- Go to the **Configurations** page and click the **Training** tab. This page shows the training status of your app.\n- To pause training, click **Pause training** .\n- To resume a paused training, click **Resume training** .", "guide": "Vertex AI Search and Conversation"}
