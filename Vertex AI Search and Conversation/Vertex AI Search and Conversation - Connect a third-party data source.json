Third-party data source support is in preview with allowlist.\nTo connect a third-party data source, go to the section for the source you plan to use:\n- [Connect Confluence](#confluence) \n- [Connect Jira](#jira) \n- [Connect Salesforce](#salesforce) \n- [Connect ServiceNow](#servicenow) \nTo import data from a Google data source instead, see [Create a search datastore](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-data-store-es) .\n", "content": "## Connect Confluence\nUse the following procedure to sync data from Confluence to Vertex AI Search.\nAfter you set up your data source and import data the first time, the data store syncs data from that source at a frequency that you select during setup.\nBefore setting up your connection:\n- Set up access control for your data source. For information about setting up access control, see [Use data source access control](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/data-source-access-control) .\n- Have the following authentication information ready:- Instance URL\n- Instance ID\n- Client ID and client secret. For information about OAuth 2.0 for Confluence and getting the client ID and client secret, see [OAuth 2.0(3LO) apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/) in the Atlassian Developer documentation.\n- When setting OAuth 2.0 permission scopes, configure the following scopes:- `read:content-details:confluence`\n- `read:attachment:confluence`\n- `read:group:confluence`\n- `read:user:confluence`\n- `read:space:confluence`\n- `read:content.metadata:confluence`\n- `read:permission:confluence`\n- `read:configuration:confluence`The following limitation applies:\n- For user permissions to apply correctly, Confluence users must provide sharing consent.\nTo use the Google Cloud console to sync data from Confluence to Vertex AI Search, follow these steps:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page.

Vertex AI Search creates your data store and displays your data stores on the **Data stores** page.\n- To check the status of your ingestion, go to the **Data stores** page and click your data store name to see details about it on its **Data** page. The **Connector state** changes from **Creating** to **Running** when it starts synchronizing data. When ingestion is complete, the state changes to **Active** to indicate that the connection to your data source is set up and awaiting the next scheduled synchronization. Check the **Documents** tab to make sure your entities have been ingested correctly.Depending on the size of your data, ingestion can take several minutes or several hours.### Next steps\n- To attach your data store to an app, create an app and select your data store following the steps in [Create a search app](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-engine-es) .\n- See [Preview results for apps with third-party accesscontrol](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/data-source-access-control#preview) .## Connect Jira\nUse the following procedure to sync data from Jira Cloud to Vertex AI Search.\nAfter you set up your data source and import data the first time, the data store syncs data from that source at a frequency that you select during setup.\nBefore setting up your connection:\n- Set up access control for your data source.
