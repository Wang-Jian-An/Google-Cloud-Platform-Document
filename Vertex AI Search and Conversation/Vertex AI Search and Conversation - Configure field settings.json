You can use the **Schema** tab in the Google Cloud console to configure field settings for structured data and unstructured data with metadata.\nConfiguring field settings is available only for apps with data stores that have either structured data or unstructured data with metadata.\nThe following field settings are available:\n| Field setting  | Definition                                                                    | Use case  |\n|:------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------|\n| Indexable   | If a field is set to Indexable, Vertex AI Search can filter, order, and facet using this field. Setting boolean and object fields to indexable is not supported.                              | Search   |\n| Searchable  | If a field is set to Searchable, recall for that field in Vertex AI Search queries is improved. Only fields with text values can be set to Searchable.                                | Search   |\n| Dynamic facetable | If a field is set to Dynamic Facetable, Vertex AI Search can use that field as a dynamic facet. Dynamic facets can be automatically added to a search based on previous user behavior such as facet clicks and views. This setting is applicable only to fields that are indexable. | Search   |\n| Retreivable  | If a field is set to Retrievable, Vertex AI Search returns the field in search results.                                                | Search   |\n| Completable  | If a field is set to Completable, Vertex AI Search uses the field's contents as search query suggestions. For more information, see Configure autocomplete.                               | Search   |\n| Filterable  | If a field is set to Filterable, Vertex AI Search recommendations can use that field to filter recommendations results. For information about filtering recommendations, see Filter recommendations.                    | Recommendations |\n", "content": "## Limitations\nField settings have the following limitations:\n- You can configure up to 50 fields as indexable, searchable, or dynamic facetable.\n- You can configure up to 30 fields as retrievable.\n- To configure a field as dynamic facetable, it must first be configured as indexable.\n- Changing the indexable setting requires re-indexing the data, which can take hours, especially for large data stores.\nIf you are configuring fields for a media search app and want detailed information about the fields in the schema, see [About media documents and datastores](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/media-documents) .\n## Update field settings\nTo update field settings:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page. [Search and Conversation](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/start) \n- Click the name of the app that you want to edit.\n- Click **Data** .\n- Click the **Schema** tab. This tab shows current field settings.\n- Click **Edit** .\n- Select or clear field settings that you need to update. Some field settings are not supported. For example, numerical fields cannot be set to **Searchable** .\n- Click **Save** to apply your changes.## What's next\n- [Update a schema for structured data](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/update-schemas) \n- [Configure search results](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/configure-widget-attributes) \n- [Preview search results](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/preview-search-results)", "guide": "Vertex AI Search and Conversation"}
