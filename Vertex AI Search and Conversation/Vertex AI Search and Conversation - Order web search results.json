It does not work with web data stores that have [advanced website indexing](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/about-advanced-features#advanced-website-indexing) turned on.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\nMake sure that you do the following:\n- Create a data store with website data. For more information, see [WebsiteURLs](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-data-store-es#website) .\n- Create a search app and connect it to the data store. For more information, see [Create a search app](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-engine-es) .## Order your web search results\nTo use the API to order your web search results for an app with website data, use the [servingConfigs.search](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataStores.servingConfigs/search) method:- Find your data store ID. If you already have your data store ID, skip to the next step.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page and in the navigation menu, click **Data stores** . [Go to the Data stores page](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/data-stores) \n- Click the name of your data store.\n- On the **Data** page for your data store, get the data store ID.\n- Make a search query and include the `orderBy` field.```\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1beta/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/DATA_STORE_ID/servingConfigs/default_search:search\" \\-d '{\"servingConfig\": \"projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/DATA_STORE_ID/servingConfigs/default_search\",\"query\": \"QUERY\",\"orderBy\": \"ORDER_BY\"}'\n```Replace the following:- : The ID of your project.\n- : The ID of your data store.\n- : The query text to search.\n- : The order in which the results are arranged. For example, specifying`date`returns web pages sorted by Google's estimate for each page's date. These estimates are based on features of the web pages such as the date in the title and URL. The default sort order is descending (pages with the most recent dates are returned first). To get ascending sort order, append`:a`to the`date`value\u2014for example,`date:a`.", "guide": "Vertex AI Search and Conversation"}
