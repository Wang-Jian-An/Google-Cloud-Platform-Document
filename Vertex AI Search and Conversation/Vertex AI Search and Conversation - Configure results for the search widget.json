By default, a snippet is displayed for each search result.\n- **Search with an answer** This feature provides a paragraph of information (the answer) synthesized from the top results. You can customize the number of top results that the answer is based on. By default, the top five results are summarized to create the answer. Search with an answer cannot be combined with Search with follow-ups.\n- **Search with follow-ups.** This feature allows for follow-up questions that keep the context of the initial search query. For more information, see [Search with follow-ups](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/multi-turn-search) .\n- **Autocomplete.** Suggests search queries based on the first letters that users enter into the search bar. For more information, see [Configureautocomplete](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/configure-autocomplete) .\n- **Feedback.** Provides buttons thumb_up and thumb_down so that users can rate the quality of the search results. For more information, see [Configurewidget feedback](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/configure-feedback) .\n- **Metadata.** If the unstructured data store contains metadata, you can choose what metadata fields to include in the search results. You can also map fields to display names for facets. For more information, see [Configure facets for the search widget](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/configure-widget-facets) .\n- **Turning off Advanced LLM features.** If you turn off Advanced LLM features for a search widget that is using search with follow-ups or search with an answer, the widget stops working for all users. See [Turn Advanced LLM features on or off](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/advanced-llm) .## Configure search results for structured data\n**Note:** This feature is a Preview offering, subject to the \"Pre-GA Offerings Terms\" of the [GCP Service Specific Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms) . Pre-GA products and features may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA products and features may not be compatible with other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) . Further, by using this feature, you agree to the [Generative AI Preview terms and conditions](https://cloud.google.com/trustedtester/aitos) (\"Preview Terms\"). For this feature, you can process personal data as outlined in the [Cloud Data Processing Addendum](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms) , subject to applicable restrictions and obligations in the Agreement (as defined in the Preview Terms).\nFor structured data, by default, the widget displays all of the name-value pairs for each item in the search results. You can use the **Configurations** page in the Google Cloud console to customize how the widget displays search results.\nThe following list shows the primary fields for displaying search results:\n- **Title.** An item title that a user can click to select that item in a search result.\n- **Thumbnail.** The URL of an image to be shown next to the item title in a search result.\n- **URL.** A URL that the user is taken to when they click the item's title.\nYou can display up to three additional fields in your search results and configure how they appear.\nTo configure how the widget displays search results for structured data:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Search and Conversation** page. [Search and Conversation](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/start) \n- Click the name of the search app that you want to edit.\n- Click **Configurations** .\n- Click the **Widget** tab.\n- Expand the **Change fields in search results** section.\n- In the **Preview** pane, type a query and press **Enter** to view how search results are displayed with your current settings. The preview updates automatically when you enter new settings.\n- Optional: Click a device icon to see the preview in desktop or mobile format.\n- To configure the primary fields ( **Title** , **Thumbnail** , and **URL** ) in your search results:- Click the **Title** box and select a field to map to the titles of your search results. Or, select **None** if you don't want titles to appear in search results.\n- Click the **Thumbnail** box and select a field to map to the thumbnail images in your search results. Or, select **None** if you don't want thumbnail images to appear in search results.\n- Click the **URL** box and select a field that maps to the items that open when users click item titles in search results. Or, select **None** if you don't want item titles in your search results to link to items.\n- To add additional fields to your search results:- Click the **Text 1** box and select a field that you want to display in your search results. By default, only the field value is displayed in search results.\n- Click the arrow next to the **Text 1** box to display the **Template** box. The **{value}** field in **Template** box represents the field value to display in the search result. Add text before or after the **{value}** field (or both) to give context to the value in the search results. For example, suppose you selected `price` in the **Text 1** box, and the price value for a particular item is 42. If you update the **Template** field to `\"Total Price: {value} USD\"` , then \"Total Price: 42 USD\" is displayed in the search results for that item.\n- To add additional fields, repeat these steps for the **Text 2** and **Text 3** boxes.\n- Check the **Preview** pane to make sure your changes display correctly.\n- Click **Save and publish** to apply your changes.\n**Note:** For information about enabling autocomplete, see [Configureautocomplete](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/configure-autocomplete) . For information about enabling feedback, see [Configure widgetfeedback](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/configure-feedback) .\n## Next steps\n- [Get search results](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/preview-search-results) \n- [Add the search widget to a web page](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/add-widget)", "guide": "Vertex AI Search and Conversation"}
