For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\n", "content": "## \n Problem: double slashes in a request can cause the request not to resolve\nAny request that contains a two (or more) consecutive slashes can result in a 404 error. For example `/hello//world/` . The problem in this example is the \" `//` \" between `hello` and `world` .\n## \n Solution: filter for double slashes\nApply a configuration to your Istio ingress to filter for double slashes in requests and replace them.\n- Create a new configuration file named`apigee-merge-slash-filter.yaml`.\n- Paste the following content into the file:```\napiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\nkind: EnvoyFilter\nmetadata:\n name: apigee-merge-slashes\n namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n workloadSelector:\n labels:\n  app: istio-ingressgateway\n configPatches:\n - applyTo: NETWORK_FILTER # http connection manager is a filter in Envoy\n match:\n  context: GATEWAY\n  listener:\n  filterChain:\n   filter:\n   name: \"envoy.http_connection_manager\"\n patch:\n  operation: MERGE\n  value:\n  typed_config:\n   \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager\"\n   merge_slashes: true\n```\n- Apply the configuration with the following command:```\nkubectl apply -f apigee-merge-slash-filter.yaml\n```", "guide": "Apigee"}
