[Go to the Feature Store page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/feature-store) \n- Click **Online store** .\n- In the **Online stores** section, you can view the list of all the online stores for the selected location.\nTo retrieve a list of all the [FeatureOnlineStore](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores#resource:-featureOnlineStore) resources in your project, send a `GET` request by using the [featureOnlineStores.list](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores/list) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region for which you want to view the list of online stores, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X GET \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\n$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token$headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $cred\" }Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores\" | Select-Object -Expand Content\n```\nYou should see output similar to the following. You can use the in the response to [get the status](/vertex-ai/docs/general/long-running-operations) of the operation.\n```\n{\n \"featureOnlineStores\": [ {\n  \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME_1\",\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-09-06T23:25:04.256314Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-09-06T23:25:04.256314Z\",\n  \"etag\": \"AMEw9yMgoV0bAsYuKwVxz4Y7lOmxV7riNVHg217KaQAKORqvdqGCrQ1DIt8yHgoGXf8=\",\n  \"bigtable\": {\n  \"autoScaling\": {\n   \"minNodeCount\": 1,\n   \"maxNodeCount\": 4,\n   \"cpuUtilizationTarget\": 70\n  }\n  }\n },\n {\n  \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME_2\",\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-07-21T14:24:20.206446Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-07-21T14:24:20.206446Z\",\n  \"etag\": \"AMEw9yPTfvIHvpFD-mbtMVKG4Sp_y08aDFZiZl4m_97VvC0YiyEVj-sbDo_NkVueeBo=\",\n  \"bigtable\": {\n  \"autoScaling\": {\n   \"minNodeCount\": 1,\n   \"maxNodeCount\": 4,\n   \"cpuUtilizationTarget\": 70\n  }\n  }\n }\n ]\n}\n```\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn how to [create a feature view within an online store](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featureview) .\n- Learn how to [update an online store](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-onlinestore) .\n- Learn how to [delete an online store](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/delete-onlinestore) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
