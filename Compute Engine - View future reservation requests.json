Pre-GA products and features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nThis document explains how to view future reservation requests.\nTo view other reservations, including those auto-created for a future reservation to provision the reserved resources, see [View reservations](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-view) instead.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\n- If you haven't already, set up authentication. [Authentication](/compute/docs/authentication) is the process by which your identity is verified for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to Compute Engine as follows.Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:\nWhen you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and   APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:```\ngcloud init\n``` **Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI  previously, make sure you have the latest version by running`gcloud components  update`.\n- [ Set a default region and zone](/compute/docs/gcloud-compute#set_default_zone_and_region_in_your_local_client) .\nTo use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:\n- ```\ngcloud init\n```\n### Required roles\nTo get the permissions that you need to view future reservation requests,   ask your administrator to grant you the [Compute Future Reservation Viewer ](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#compute.futureReservationViewer) ( `roles/compute.futureReservationViewer` ) IAM role on the project.    For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nThis predefined role contains     the permissions required to view future reservation requests. To see the exact permissions that are   required, expand the **Required permissions** section:\nYou might also be able to get   these permissions  with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or  other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\n## View your future reservation requests\nTo view the future reservation requests in a specified project, select one of the following methods:\n- [View a list of future reservation requests](#view-list-future-reservations) .This section explains how to view a list of all drafted or submitted future reservation requests in a specified project. You can also use filters to narrow down results based on one or more attributes.\n- [View details of a future reservation request](#view-details-future-reservation) .This section explains how to view the details of a future reservation request, such as the projects a shared future reservation is shared with or the start time of its reservation period.\n### View a list of future reservation requests\nYou can view a list of future reservation requests in a specified project using the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI, and REST.\n**Note:** If you want to use more advanced [filter expressions](/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/filters) to filter a list of future reservation requests, you must use the gcloud CLI or REST.\nTo view a list of future reservation requests, follow these steps:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Reservations** page. [Go to Reservations](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/reservations) \n- Click the **Future reservations** tab.In the table, each row describes a future reservation request and each column describes a property. For example, the **Total count** column describes the reserved capacity of each future reservation request.\n- Optional: To filter the future reservation requests displayed in the table, do one or both of the following:- In the filter_list **Filter** field, enter a [filter expression](/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/filters) .For example, to only view the future reservation requests that were created in zone `us-central1-a` or which reserved more than 10 resources, specify the following expression:```\nZone:us-central1-a OR Total Count>10\n```\n- Click view_column **Column display options** , and then select the values that you want to filter the table by.\nTo view a list of future reservation requests, use the [gcloud beta compute future-reservations list command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/future-reservations/list) .\n```\ngcloud beta compute future-reservations list \\\n --project=PROJECT_ID\n```\nReplace `` with the ID of the project where one or more future reservation requests are located. If you omit the `--project` flag, the ID of the current project is used.\nThe output is similar to the following:\n```\nNAME   TOTAL_COUNT START_TIME    END_TIME    PROCUREMENT_STATUS ZONE\nfr-04   100   2025-07-20T07:00:00Z 2025-08-05T07:00:00Z FULFILLED   us-east1-a\nfr-05   10    2025-11-15T00:00:00Z 2025-12-01T00:00:00Z PENDING_APPROVAL  us-west1-c\n```\nOptionally, you can specify the `--filter` flag to view a filtered list of future reservations based on a filter expression.\n```\ngcloud beta compute future-reservations list \\\n --filter=\"FILTER_EXPRESSION\" \\\n --project=PROJECT_ID\n```\nReplace the following:- `` with a [filter expression](/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/filters) .For example, to only view future reservations that were created in zone `us-central1-a` , specify an `n2-standard-4` machine type, and have a total count greater than 10, specify the following filter expression:```\nspecificSkuProperties.instanceProperties.machineType=n2-standard-4 AND specificSkuProperties.totalCount>10 AND zone=us-central1-a\n```\n- `` : Optional.
