For more information about IAM Conditions, see [Overview of IAM Conditions](/iam/docs/conditions-overview) .\nIn Apigee Integration, you can enforce conditional access based on the following attributes:\n- **Date/time attributes:** Use to set temporary (expiring), scheduled, or limited-duration access to Apigee Integration resources. For example, you can allow a user to access an integration until a specified date. For more information, see [Configuring temporary access](/iam/docs/configuring-temporary-access) .\n- **Resource attributes** : Use to configure conditional access based on a resource name, resource type, or resource service attributes. For example, you can allow a user to manage integrations that are created in a specific region. For a list of supported values. For more information, see [Configuring resource-based access](/iam/docs/configuring-resource-based-access) .", "content": "## Add IAM condition\nTo add an IAM condition to a existing principal (user, group, or service account), perform the following steps:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page. [Go  to IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/iam?supportedpurview=project,folder,organizationId) \n- Select your project, folder, or organization.\n- From the list of principals, find the principal for which you want to add the IAM condition, and clickedit( **Edit principal** ).The **Edit access** pane appears.\n- Find the role to which you want to add the IAM condition and click **+ Add IAM Condition** .\n- In the **Add condition** pane, provide the following information:- **Title:** Enter a name for the condition that you're adding to the role.\n- **Description:** (Optional) Enter a description for the condition.\n- You can add a condition using either the **Condition Builder** or the **Condition Editor** .The **Condition Builder** provides an interactive interface to select your desired condition type, operator, and other applicable details about the expression. The **Condition Editor** provides a text-based interface to manually enter a condition expression using [CEL](/iam/docs/conditions-overview#cel) syntax.For detailed instructions about how to use the **Condition Builder** or the **Condition Editor** , see [Configure resource-based access](/iam/docs/configuring-resource-based-access) .\n- Click **Save** to apply the condition.\n- For information about the supported resource attributes for Apigee Integration, see [Resource attribute values](#values) \n- Click **Save** again from the **Edit access** pane to update the principal.## Resource attribute values\nThe following table lists the values that the resource type attribute can contain for Apigee Integration:\n| Resource name  | Resource type             | Reference  |\n|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------|\n| Location   | SERVICE_ENDPOINT-integrations.googleapis.com/Location   | API reference |\n| Integration  | SERVICE_ENDPOINT-integrations.googleapis.com/Integration  | API reference |\n| IntegrationVersion | SERVICE_ENDPOINT-integrations.googleapis.com/IntegrationVersion | API reference |\n| Execution   | SERVICE_ENDPOINT-integrations.googleapis.com/Execution   | API reference |\n| Suspension   | SERVICE_ENDPOINT-integrations.googleapis.com/Suspension   | API reference |\n| AuthConfig   | SERVICE_ENDPOINT-integrations.googleapis.com/AuthConfig   | API reference |\n## Examples of using IAM Condtions for Apigee Integration", "guide": "Apigee"}
