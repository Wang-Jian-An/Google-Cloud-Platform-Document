We recommend that you validate all output from Duet AI before you use it. For more information, see [Duet AI in Google Cloud and responsible AI](/duet-ai/docs/discover/responsible-ai) .\nThis document describes how you can use [Duet AI](/duet-ai/docs/overview) , an AI-powered collaborator in Google Cloud, to use inline code completion in a Colab Enterprise notebook.\nDuet AI doesn't use your prompts or its responses as data to train its model. For more information, see [How Duet AI in Google Cloud uses your data](/duet-ai/docs/discover/data-governance) .\nThis document is intended for data analysts, data scientists, and data developers who work with Colab Enterprise. It assumes you have knowledge of how to write code in a notebook environment.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\n### Required roles\nTo ensure that your user account has the necessary  permissions to use code completion in a Colab Enterprise notebook,   ask your administrator to grant your user account the   Colab Enterprise User ( [roles/aiplatform.colabEnterpriseUser](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.colabEnterpriseUser) ) IAM role on the project.    For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nYour administrator might also be able to give your user account  the required permissions through [custom  roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined  roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\nUsers assigned the Code Creator role in a project can list the names of code assets in that project by using the Dataform API or the Dataform command-line interface (CLI). In preview, non-administrators using BigQuery Studio can only see code assets that they created or that were shared with them.\n## Write code by using code completion\nTo use inline code completion in a Colab Enterprise notebook, do the following:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to  the Colab Enterprise **Notebooks** page. [Go to Notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/notebooks) \n- In the **Region** menu, select the region that contains your notebook.\n- On the **My notebooks** tab, click the notebook  that you want to open. If you haven't created a notebook yet, [create a notebook](/colab/docs/create-console-quickstart#create) .\n- In a code cell of your notebook, start entering code.  Duet AI suggests a potential way to complete your  code in gray italic text.For example, if you enter `import p` ,  Duet AI might suggest a code completion that  imports `pandas as pd` followed by a line that reads a CSV file  and stores the contents in a pandas dataframe. \n- To accept the suggested code completion, press .## What's next\n- For information about Duet AI in Google Cloud, read [Duet AI in Google Cloudoverview](/duet-ai/docs/overview) .\n- Learn how [Duet AI uses yourdata](/duet-ai/docs/discover/data-governance) .", "guide": "Colab Enterprise"}
