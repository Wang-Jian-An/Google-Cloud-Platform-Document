For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nYour administrator might also be able to give your user account  the required permissions through [custom  roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined  roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\nUsers assigned the Code Creator role in a project can list the names of code assets in that project by using the Dataform API or the Dataform command-line interface (CLI). In preview, non-administrators using BigQuery Studio can only see code assets that they created or that were shared with them.\n## Grant access to a notebook\nTo grant a principal access to a Colab Enterprise notebook:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to  the Colab Enterprise **Notebooks** page.
