For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nYour administrator might also be able to give your user account  the required permissions through [custom  roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined  roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\nUsers assigned the Code Creator role in a project can list the names of code assets in that project by using the Dataform API or the Dataform command-line interface (CLI). In preview, non-administrators using BigQuery Studio can only see code assets that they created or that were shared with them.\n## Grant access to a runtime template\nTo grant a principal access to a runtime template:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to  the Colab Enterprise **Runtime Templates** page. [Go to Runtime templates](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/runtime-templates) \n- In the **Region** menu, select the region that contains  your runtime template.\n- In the **Runtime template** menu,  select a runtime template.

[ Go to IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/iam?supportedpurview=project,folder,organizationId) \n- Select a project, folder, or organization.\n- Find the row containing the principal whose access you want to revoke. Then, click edit **Edit principal** in that row. **Note:** You cannot edit inherited roles when managing access to a resource. To edit inherited roles, go to the resource where the role was granted.\n- Click the **Delete** delete button for the role that you want to revoke, and then click **Save** .## What's next\n- To learn how to grant access to a notebook, see [Manage accessto a notebook](/colab/docs/manage-access-notebook) .", "guide": "Colab Enterprise"}
