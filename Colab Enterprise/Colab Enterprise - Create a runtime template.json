You can use the default runtime or a runtime created from a runtime template. By creating a runtime template, you can configure the template to optimize a runtime's performance, cost, and other characteristics based on your needs.\nLearn more about [runtimes and runtime templates](/colab/docs/runtimes) .\n", "content": "## Before you begin\n### Required roles\nTo ensure that your user account has the necessary  permissions to create a runtime template in Colab Enterprise,   ask your administrator to grant your user account the   Colab Enterprise Admin ( [roles/aiplatform.colabEnterpriseAdmin](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.colabEnterpriseAdmin) ) IAM role on the project.    For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nYour administrator might also be able to give your user account  the required permissions through [custom  roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined  roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\nUsers assigned the Code Creator role in a project can list the names of code assets in that project by using the Dataform API or the Dataform command-line interface (CLI). In preview, non-administrators using BigQuery Studio can only see code assets that they created or that were shared with them.\n## Create the runtime template\nTo create a runtime template:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to  the Colab Enterprise **Runtime Templates** page. [Go to Runtime templates](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/runtime-templates) \n- Click add_box **New  template** .The **Create new runtime template** dialog appears.\n### Runtime basics\n- In the **Runtime basics** section, enter  a **Display name** .\n- In the **Region** menu, select the region where you want  your runtime template.\n- Optional: Add a **Description** of  your runtime template.\n- Optional: To add a label, click add **Add label** ,  and then enter a **Key** and **Value** pair.  To add more labels, repeat this step.\n- Click **Continue** .\n### Configure compute\n- In the **Configure compute** section,  in the **Machine type** menu, select a machine type.  For information on machine types, see the [Machine families resource and  comparison guide](/compute/docs/machine-resource) .\n- In the **Disk type** menu, select a disk type.\n- In the **Disk size** field, enter a size in GB.\n- In the **Idle shutdown** section:- To disable idle shutdown, clear **Enable idle shutdown** .\n- To change the inactivity time period, in **Time of inactivity before shutdown (Minutes)** ,   change the number to the number of minutes of inactivity that   you want. In the Google Cloud console, this setting can be set   to any integer value from 10 to 1440.\n- Idle shutdown is an Experimental setting.

If you don't  select a network, your default network is selected.\n- In the **Subnetwork** menu, select a subnetwork.\n- To turn off public internet access,  clear **Enable public internet access** .\n- To turn off end-user credential access,  clear **Enable end-user credentials** .\n### Finish creating the runtime template\nClick **Create** to finish creating the runtime template.\nYour runtime template appears in the list on the **Runtime templates** tab.\n## Granting access to the runtime template\nAfter you create a runtime template, you must grant access to it for a principal to be able to use it. A principal can [create a runtime](/colab/docs/create-runtime) from a runtime template only when they have the following:\n- Access to the runtime template.\n- The required permissions for creating runtimes.\nSee [Manage access to a runtimetemplate](/colab/docs/manage-access-runtime-template) .\n## What's next\n- Learn more about [runtimes and runtime templates](/colab/docs/runtimes) .\n- Learn how to [create a runtime](/colab/docs/create-runtime) based on a runtime template.", "guide": "Colab Enterprise"}
