Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nWhen you are working with AutoML image models, you can configure specific parameters to improve your explanations. This guide describes how to inspect the explanations that you get from Vertex Explainable AI for error, and it describes how to adjust your Vertex Explainable AI configuration to mitigate error.\nThe [Vertex Explainable AI feature attributionmethods](/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/overview#compare-methods) are all based on variants of Shapley values. Because Shapley values are very computationally expensive, Vertex Explainable AI provides approximations instead of the exact values.\nYou can reduce the approximation error and get closer to the exact values by changing the following inputs:\n- Increasing the number of integral steps or number of paths.\n#", "content": "## Increasing steps\nTo reduce approximation error, you can increase:\n- the **Number of integral steps** in the UI## What's next\n- Explore the [Limitations of Vertex Explainable AI](/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/limitations) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
