Llama 2 models are pre-trained and fine-tuned generative text models.\nDetails about Llama 2 models and how to use them in Vertex AI are on the Llama model card in Model Garden. To access the Llama 2 model card, go to [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) and search for **Llama 2** .
