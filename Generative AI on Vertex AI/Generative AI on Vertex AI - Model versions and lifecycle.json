The Gemini and PaLM model versioning and naming conventions are similar, but not identical. See the following topics to learn about how model versioning works with Gemini and PaLM models. To learn about Imagen on Vertex AI model versions and their lifecycle, see [Imagen on Vertex AI model versions and lifecycle](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/image/model-versioning) .\n", "content": "## Gemini model versions and lifecycle\nThe Gemini language models are multimodal which means they can process information from more than one modality, such as images, videos, and text. Gemini models include .\n### Gemini stable version\nA version of a Gemini model does not change and continues to be available for approximately six months after the release date of the next version of the model. For example, `gemini-1.0-pro-001` is available for six months after the release date of `gemini-1.0-pro-002` . In this example, `gemini-1.0-pro-001` becomes unavailable after the six months following the release date of `gemini-1.0-pro-002` . If you use a version that becomes unavailable, you need to switch to a newer available version. You can identify the version of a model by the three-digit number that's appended to the model name. For example, `gemini-1.0-pro-001` is version number one of the stable release of the Gemini 1.0 Pro model.\nGoogle releases versions on a regular cadence. You can switch from one version to another as long as the other version is still available. When you move from one version to a different version, you need to run your tuning jobs again because there might be prompt, output, and other differences between the versions.\nTo use the version of a Gemini model, append the three digit version number to the model with a hyphen ( `-` ). For example, to specify the stable `gemini-1.0-pro` model that's version six, append `-006` to the model's name:\n`https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my_project/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/gemini-1.0-pro-006`\nThe following model versions are available for generally available Gemini models:\n| Gemini 1.0 Pro model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:-----------------------|:------------------|:-----------------------|\n| gemini-1.0-pro-001  | February 15, 2024 | Not applicable   |\n| Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:------------------------------|:------------------|:-----------------------|\n| gemini-1.0-pro-vision-001  | February 15, 2024 | Not applicable   |### Gemini auto-updated version\nThe version of a Gemini model points to the most recent stable version. When a new stable version is released, the auto-updated version points to the new version. This means that if you specify the auto-updated version of a Gemini model in your code, it could behave differently without notice when the next stable version is released. Because of this, use a auto-updated version with caution if you tune your model.\nTo use the version of a model, don't append anything to the model name. For example, the following uses the version of the `gemini-1.0-pro-vision` model:\n`https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my_project/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/gemini-1.0-pro-vision`\nThe following table shows the available Gemini model versions and the stable version each references.\n| Model name     | Auto-updated name  | Referenced stable version |\n|:----------------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------------|\n| Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model | gemini-1.0-pro-vision | gemini-1.0-pro-vision-001 |\n| Gemini 1.0 Pro model  | gemini-1.0-pro  | gemini-1.0-pro-001   |\n## PaLM model versions and lifecycle\nThe PaLM language models include text and code models, such as `text-bison` , `text-unicorn` , `chat-bison` , `code-bison` , and `code-gecko` . The versions differ by whether they change over time or not and by how long they're available.\n### PaLM stable version\nA version of a model does not change and continues to be available for six months after the release date of the next version of the model. For example, `text-bison@001` is available for six months after the release date of `text-bison@002` . In this example, `text-bison@001` becomes unavailable after the six months following the release date of `text-bison@002` . If you use a version that becomes unavailable, you need to switch to a newer available version. You can identify the version of a model by the three-digit number that's appended to the model name. For example, `text-bison@001` is version number one of the stable release of the Vertex AI [Generative AI text model](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/text/text-prompts) .\nGoogle releases versions on a regular cadence. You can switch from one version to another as long as the other version is still available. When you move from one version to a different version, you need to run your tuning jobs again because there might be prompt, output, and other differences between the versions.\nThe following model versions are available for generally available Generative AI models:\n| chat-bison model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:-------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|\n| chat-bison@002  | December 6, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| chat-bison@001  | July 10, 2023 | July 6, 2024   |\n| chat-bison-32k model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|\n| chat-bison-32k@002  | December 4, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| code-bison model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:-------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|\n| code-bison@002  | December 6, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| code-bison@001  | June 29, 2023 | July 6, 2024   |\n| code-bison-32k model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|\n| code-bison-32k@002  | December 4, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| codechat-bison model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|\n| codechat-bison@002  | December 6, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| codechat-bison@001  | June 29, 2023 | July 6, 2024   |\n| codechat-bison-32k model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:---------------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|\n| codechat-bison-32k@002  | December 4, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| code-gecko model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:-------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|\n| code-gecko@002  | December 6, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| code-gecko@001  | June 29, 2023 | July 6, 2024   |\n| text-bison model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:-------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|\n| text-bison@002  | December 6, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| text-bison@001  | June 7, 2023  | July 6, 2024   |\n| text-bison-32k model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|\n| text-bison-32k@002  | December 4, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| text-unicorn model | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:---------------------|:------------------|:-----------------------|\n| text-unicorn@001  | November 30, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| textembedding-gecko model   | Release date  | Discontinuation date |\n|:-------------------------------------|:------------------|:-----------------------|\n| textembedding-gecko@003    | December 12, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| textembedding-gecko@002    | November 2, 2023 | December 12, 2024  |\n| textembedding-gecko-multilingual@001 | November 2, 2023 | Not applicable   |\n| textembedding-gecko@001    | June 7, 2023  | November 2, 2024  |### PaLM latest version\nThe version of a model is updated periodically and includes incremental updates and improvements. These changes might result in subtle differences in the output over time for a given prompt. The version of a model is not guaranteed to be stable.\nTo use the version of a language model, append the three digit version number to the model. For example, to specify the stable `text-bison` model that's version six, append `@006` to the model's name:\n`https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my_project/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/text-bison@006`\nTo use the version of a model, don't append anything to the model name. For example, the following uses the version of the `codechat-bison` model:\n`https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my_project/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/codechat-bison`\n**Important:** If you want to call the version of `textembedding-gecko` models, you must add `@latest` as a suffix. For example, `textembedding-gecko@latest` .\nThe following table shows the identifiers for the available Generative AI model versions:\n| 0            | 1                 |\n|:-------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PaLM 2 for Text (text-bison) models    | text-bison text-bison-32k           |\n| PaLM 2 for Chat (chat-bison) models    | chat-bison chat-bison-32k           |\n| Codey for Code Generation (code-bison) models | code-bison code-bison-32k           |\n| Codey for Code Chat (codechat-bison) models  | codechat-bison codechat-bison-32k         |\n| Codey for Code Completion (code-gecko) models | code-gecko               |\n| Embeddings for Text (textembedding-gecko models) | textembedding-gecko@latest textembedding-gecko-multilingual@latest |\n## What's next\n- Try a quickstart tutorial using [Vertex AI Studio](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart) or the [Vertex AI API](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal) .\n- Explore pretrained models in [Model Garden](/vertex-ai/docs/start/explore-models) .\n- Learn how to [tune a foundation model](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/tune-models) .", "guide": "Generative AI on Vertex AI"}
