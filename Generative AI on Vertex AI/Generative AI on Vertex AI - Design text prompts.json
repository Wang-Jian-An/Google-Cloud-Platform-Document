Some of the most common tasks are classification, summarization, and extraction. You can learn more about designing text prompts for these common tasks in the following pages:\n- [Classification prompts](#classification_prompts) \n- [Summarization prompts](#summarization_prompts) \n- [Extraction prompts](#extraction_prompts) ## Classification prompts\nClassification tasks assign a class or category to text. You can specify a list of categories to choose from or let the model choose from its own categories. This page shows you how to create prompts that classify text.\n### Classification use cases\nThe following are common use cases for text classification:\n- **Fraud detection** : Classify whether transactions in financial data are fraudulent or not.\n- **Spam filtering** : Identify whether an email is spam or not.\n- **Sentiment analysis** : Classify the sentiment conveyed in text as positive or negative. For example, you can classify movie reviews or email as positive or negative.\n- **Content moderation** : Identify and flag content that might be harmful, such as offensive language or phishing.\n### Best practices for classification prompts\nTry setting the temperature to zero and top-K to one. Classification tasks are typically deterministic, so these settings often produce the best results.\n### Example classification prompts\nUse the following examples to learn how to design classification prompts for various use cases.\n- [Sentiment analysis prompt](#sentiment-classification) \n- [Content classification prompt](#content-classification) \n- [Movie classification prompt](#movie-classification) Sentiment analysis evaluates text and classifies it as positive or negative. Including sentiment analysis in a prompt is useful when analyzing content such as reviews, feedback, and emails.\nThe following prompt classifies the sentiment of a review:\n| 0                                                                                          |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Give the sentiment of this review.

Unlike any other shoes I've purchased in the past. It looks nice, but it's not comfortable. Response: Negative The reviewer expresses disappointment with the shoe's lack of support and comfort, despite its stylish appearance. The reviewer also mentions that the shoe is flimsy and not like any other shoes they have purchased in the past. They say that the shoe looks nice, but it's not comfortable, which suggests that the style of the shoe is not enough to compensate for its lack of comfort.

(gemini-1.0-pro) |\n## Summarization prompts\nSummarization tasks extract the most important information from text. You can provide information in the prompt to help the model create a summary, or ask the model to create a summary on its own. This page shows you how to design prompts to create different kinds of summarizaries.\n### Summarization use cases\nThe following are common use cases for summarization:\n- **Summarize text** : Summarize text content such as the following:- News articles.\n- Research papers.\n- Legal documents.\n- Financial documents.\n- Technical documents.\n- Customer feedback.\n- **Content generation** : Generate content for an article, blog, or product description.\n### Best practices\nUse the following guidelines to create optimal text summaries:\n- Specify any characteristics that you want the summary to have.\n- For more creative summaries, specify higher temperature, top-K, and top-P values. For more information, learn about the`temperature`,`topK`, and`topP`parameters in [Text parameterdefinitions](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/api-quickstart#parameter_definitions) .\n- When you write your prompt, focus on the purpose of the summary and what you want to get out of it.\n### Example summarization prompts\nUse the following examples to learn how to design summarization prompts for various use cases.\n- [Article summarization prompt](#article-summarization) \n- [Chat summarization prompt](#chat-summarization) \n- [Hashtag tokenization summary prompt](#hashtag-tokenization-summary) The following prompt summarizes the main points of an article:\n| 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Provide a summary for the following article: The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to 'beat the market' consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information. Because the EMH is formulated in terms of risk adjustment, it only makes testable predictions when coupled with a particular model of risk. As a result, research in financial economics since at least the 1990s has focused on market anomalies, that is, deviations from specific models of risk. The idea that financial market returns are difficult to predict goes back to Bachelier, Mandelbrot, and Samuelson, but is closely associated with Eugene Fama, in part due to his influential 1970 review of the theoretical and empirical research. The EMH provides the basic logic for modern risk-based theories of asset prices, and frameworks such as consumption-based asset pricing and intermediary asset pricing can be thought of as the combination of a model of risk with the EMH. Many decades of empirical research on return predictability has found mixed evidence. Research in the 1950s and 1960s often found a lack of predictability (e.g. Ball and Brown 1968; Fama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll 1969), yet the 1980s-2000s saw an explosion of discovered return predictors (e.g. Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein 1985; Campbell and Shiller 1988; Jegadeesh and Titman 1993). Since the 2010s, studies have often found that return predictability has become more elusive, as predictability fails to work out-of-sample (Goyal and Welch 2008), or has been weakened by advances in trading technology and investor learning (Chordia, Subrahmanyam, and Tong 2014; McLean and Pontiff 2016; Martineau 2021). Response: Summary: The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a theory in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information. This implies that it is impossible to consistently beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis. The EMH has been extensively researched, with mixed results. Some studies have found evidence of return predictability, while others have not. Recent research suggests that return predictability has become more elusive in recent years due to advances in trading technology and investor learning. The EMH provides the basis for modern risk-based theories of asset prices and frameworks such as consumption-based asset pricing and intermediary asset pricing.

Response: The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) posits that asset prices reflect all available information, making it challenging to consistently outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis. This hypothesis has profoundly shaped modern risk-based theories of asset pricing, such as consumption-based and intermediary asset pricing. Empirical research on return predictability has yielded mixed results, with earlier studies often showing a lack of predictability while more recent ones have identified return predictors that later failed out-of-sample or were weakened by advances in trading technology and investor learning. This text delves into the theoretical underpinnings of the EMH, its implications for market anomalies and return predictability, and the ongoing debate surrounding the EMH's validity in the face of empirical evidence.

Extraction tasks are typically deterministic, so these settings often produce the best results. For more information, learn about the `temperature` and `topK` parameters in [Text parameter definitions](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/api-quickstart#parameter_definitions) .\n### Examples of extraction tasks\nUse the following examples to learn how to design extraction prompts for various use cases.\n- [Use extraction to answer a question](#answer-question-with-extraction) .\n- [Format extracted content](#format-extracted-text) .The following prompt includes context and a question.

Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleo lakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data. Q: What does LGM stands for? A: Response: Last Glacial Maximum (gemini-1.0-pro) |\nYou can extract information from a text source and organize it into a structured format.
