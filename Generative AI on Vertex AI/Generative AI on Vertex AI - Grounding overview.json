Pre-GA products and features may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA  products and features may not be compatible with other pre-GA versions. For more information,  see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .  Further, by using the PaLM API on Vertex AI, you agree to the Generative AI Preview [ terms and conditions ](https://cloud.google.com/trustedtester/aitos?hl=en) (Preview Terms).For PaLM APIs on Vertex AI that are not GA, you can process personal data as outlined in the  Cloud Data Processing Addendum, subject to applicable restrictions and obligations in the  Agreement (as defined in the Preview Terms).\nIn the context of generative AI, grounding refers to the ability to connect model output to verifiable sources of information. By providing models with access to specific data sources, grounding tethers their output to specific data and reduces the chances of inventing content. This is particularly important in situations where accuracy and reliability are significant, for instance with financial reporting and health reporting.\nGrounding in Vertex AI Search and Conversation lets you use language models ( `text-bison` , `chat-bison` ) to generate content grounded in your own data corpus. This capability lets the model access information that goes beyond its training data. By linking to designated data stores within [Vertex AI Search](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/enterprise-search-introduction) , the grounded model can produce more accurate and relevant responses.\nGrounding provides the following benefits:\n- Reduces model hallucinations, instances where the model generates content that isn't factual.\n- Anchors model responses to specific information.\n- Enhances the trustworthiness and applicability of the generated content.\nTo get started grounding a model from Vertex AI Search and Conversation, see [Grounding in Vertex AI Search and Conversation](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/ground-language-models) .\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn about [responsible AI best practices and Vertex AI Search and Conversation's safety filters](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/responsible-ai) .\n- Learn how to ground a text model: [Grounding in Vertex AI Search and Conversation](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/ground-language-models) .", "guide": "Generative AI on Vertex AI"}
