The Vertex AI SDK includes classes for text generation, text chat, text embedding, code generation, code chat, and code completion models.\nTo learn how to install the Vertex AI SDK for Python, see [Install theVertex AI SDK for Python](/vertex-ai/docs/start/install-sdk) . To view the language model section in the [Vertex AI SDK reference guide](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/google.cloud.aiplatform) , see [Package language models](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/vertexai.language_models) .\nThe language models represented in the Vertex AI SDK are in addition to classes that help you create Vertex AI solutions that aren't related to generative AI and language models. For information about how to use the Vertex AI SDK to automate data ingestion, train models, and get predictions on Vertex AI, see [Introduction to the Vertex AI SDK for Python](/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/use-vertex-ai-python-sdk) .\n", "content": "## Language model class overview\nThe Vertex AI SDK includes language model classes that help you accomplish common generative AI tasks. The following are model classes used to work with the foundation models available in Vertex AI:\n- [ChatModel](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/vertexai.language_models.ChatModel) \u2014 Use this class to work with the text chat foundation model. The name of the currentversion of this model is`chat-bison@002`.\n- [CodeChatModel](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/vertexai.language_models.CodeChatModel) \u2014 Use this class to work with the code chat foundation model. The name of the currentversion of this model is`codechat-bison@002`.\n- [CodeGenerationModel](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/vertexai.language_models.CodeGenerationModel) \u2014 Use this class to work with the code generation and the code completion foundation models. The name of the currentversion of the code generation model is`code-bison@002`and the name of the currentversion of the code completion model is`code-gecko@001`.\n- [TextEmbeddingModel](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/vertexai.language_models.TextEmbeddingModel) \u2014 Use this class to work with the text embedding foundation model. The name of the currentversion of the code generation model is`textembedding-gecko@003`.\n- [TextGenerationModel](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/vertexai.language_models.TextGenerationModel) \u2014 Use this class to work with the text generation foundation models. The names of the currentversions of the text generation models are`text-bison@002`and`text-unicorn@001`.## Load a foundation model\nTo begin using the Vertex AI SDK to work with a foundation model, you load an instance of the model. To load a model, use the `from_pretrained` method on a language model class. Foundation models are also known as models. When you call `from_pretrained` , specify a [stable](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versioning#stable-version) version or the [latest](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versioning#latest-version) version of the model you want to work with. For more information about and versions, and how they're specified in code, see [Model versions and lifecycle](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versioning) .\nThe following sample lines of Python code show you how to load a foundation model.\n- Get version `001` of the version of the code chat pretrained model:```\nfrom vertexai.language_models import ChatModelmy_chat_model = ChatModel.from_pretrained(\"chat-bison@002\")\n```\n- Get the version of the text generation model:```\nfrom vertexai.language_models import TextGenerationModelmy_text_generation_model = TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained(\"text-bison\")\n```\nAfter you use the Vertex AI SDK to load a model, you can use the model to create generative AI solutions. Some of the tasks you can do with your loaded model are generate text and code content, stream content, create a text or code chat session, tune the model, get embeddings, and create batch predictions. Which specific tasks you can do depends on the type of model you loaded.\n## What's next\n- Learn how to [use text model classes and the Vertex AI SDK](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/sdk-for-llm/sdk-use-text-models) .\n- Learn about [use code model classes and the Vertex AI SDK](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/sdk-for-llm/sdk-use-code-models) .\n- Learn about [use the Vertex AI SDK to tune foundation models](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/sdk-for-llm/sdk-tune-models) .", "guide": "Generative AI on Vertex AI"}
