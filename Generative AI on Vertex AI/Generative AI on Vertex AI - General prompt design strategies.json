While there's no right or wrong way to design a prompt, there are common strategies that you can use to affect the model's responses. Rigorous testing and evaluation remain crucial for optimizing model performance.\nLarge language models (LLM) are trained on vast amounts of text data to learn the patterns and relationships between units of language. When given some text (the prompt), language models can predict what is likely to come next, like a sophisticated autocompletion tool. Therefore, when designing prompts, consider the different factors that can influence what a model predicts comes next.\n", "content": "## Give clear and specific instructions\nGiving the model instructions on what to do is an effective and efficient way to customize model behavior. Ensure that the instructions you give are clear and specific. Instructions can be as simple as a list of step-by-step instructions or as complex as mapping out a user's experience and mindset.\n### Define the task to perform\nDescribe in detail the task that you want the model to perform. The task can be as simple as a step-by-step list of instructions or as complex as mapping out a user's experience and mindset. The following prompt tells the model to summarize a block of text:\n| 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Summarize this text. Text: A quantum computer exploits quantum mechanical phenomena to perform calculations exponentially faster than any modern traditional computer. At very tiny scales, physical matter acts as both particles and as waves, and quantum computing uses specialized hardware to leverage this behavior. The operating principles of quantum devices is beyond the scope of classical physics. When deployed at scale, quantum computers could be used in a wide variety of applications such as: in cybersecurity to break existing encryption methods while helping researchers create new ones, in meteorology to develop better weather forecasting etc. However, the current state of the art quantum computers are still largely experimental and impractical. Response: Quantum computers utilize quantum mechanical phenomena to perform computations significantly faster than traditional computers. By exploiting the particle-wave duality of matter at tiny scales, quantum computers leverage specialized hardware to solve problems beyond classical physics. Potential applications include breaking encryption, developing better weather forecasting, and more. However, current quantum computers are still largely experimental and impractical. (gemini-pro) |\n### Specify any constraints\nSpecify any constraints on reading the prompt or generating a response. You can tell the model what to do and not to do. From the previous example, the summarization is shorter than the original text, but maybe you want the summary to be shorter. In this case, you can specify a constraint in the prompt on how long you want the summary to be:\n| 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Summarize this text in two sentences. Text: A quantum computer exploits quantum mechanical phenomena to perform calculations exponentially faster than any modern traditional computer. At very tiny scales, physical matter acts as both particles and as waves, and quantum computing uses specialized hardware to leverage this behavior. The operating principles of quantum devices is beyond the scope of classical physics. When deployed at scale, quantum computers could be used in a wide variety of applications such as: in cybersecurity to break existing encryption methods while helping researchers create new ones, in meteorology to develop better weather forecasting etc. However, the current state of the art quantum computers are still largely experimental and impractical. Response: Quantum computers use quantum mechanical phenomena to perform calculations much faster than traditional computers. They have the potential to revolutionize various fields, but current quantum computers are still experimental and impractical. (gemini-pro) |\n### Define the format of the response\nYou can also give instructions that specify the format of the response. For example, you can ask for the response to be formatted as a table, bulleted list, elevator pitch, keywords, sentence, or paragraph. The following prompt instructs the model to give bullet points of the key information in the text:\n| 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Summarize this text as bullets points of key information.

(gemini-pro) |\n### Summary\n- Give the models instructions on what to do.\n- Make the instructions clear and specific.\n- Specify any constraints or formatting requirements for the output.## Include few-shot examples\nYou can include examples in the prompt that show the model what getting it right looks like. The model attempts to identify patterns and relationships from the examples and applies them when generating a response. Prompts that contain a few examples are called prompts, while prompts that provide no examples are called . Few-shot prompts are often used to regulate the formatting, phrasing, scoping, or general patterning of model responses. Use specific and varied examples to help the model narrow its focus and generate more accurate results.\nWe recommend to always include few-shot examples in your prompts. Prompts without few-shot examples are likely to be less effective, because they show the model how to apply instructions. In fact, you can remove instructions from your prompt if your examples are clear enough in showing the task at hand.\n### Zero-shot vs few-shot prompts\nThe following zero-shot prompt asks the model to choose the best explanation.\n| 0                                                                                                       |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Please choose the best explanation to the question: Question: How is snow formed? Explanation1: Snow is formed when water vapor in the air freezes into ice crystals in the atmosphere, which can combine and grow into snowflakes as they fall through the atmosphere and accumulate on the ground. Explanation2: Water vapor freezes into ice crystals forming snow. Answer: Response: Explanation1 (gemini-pro) |\nIf your use case requires the model to produce concise responses, you can include examples in the prompt that give preference to concise responses.\nThe following prompt provides two examples that show preference to the shorter explanations. In the response, you can see that the examples guided the model to choose the shorter explanation (Explanation2) as opposed to the longer explanation (Explanation1) like it did previously.\n| 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Please choose the best explanation to the question: Question: Why is sky blue? Explanation1: The sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering, which causes shorter blue wavelengths of light to be scattered more easily than longer red wavelengths, making the sky look blue. Explanation2: Due to Rayleigh scattering effect. Answer: Explanation2 Question: What is the cause of earthquakes? Explanation1: Sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust. Explanation2: Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates suddenly slip or break apart, causing a release of energy that creates seismic waves that can shake the ground and cause damage. Answer: Explanation1 Question: How is snow formed? Explanation1: Snow is formed when water vapor in the air freezes into ice crystals in the atmosphere, which can combine and grow into snowflakes as they fall through the atmosphere and accumulate on the ground. Explanation2: Water vapor freezes into ice crystals forming snow. Answer: Response: Explanation2 (gemini-pro) |\n### Find the optimal number of examples\nYou can experiment with the number of examples to provide in the prompt for the most desired results. Models like PaLM and Gemini can often pick up on patterns using a few examples, though you may need to experiment with what number of examples lead to the desired results. For simpler models like BERT, you may need more examples. At the same time, if you include too many examples, the model may start to [overfit](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#overfitting) the response to the examples.\n### Use examples to show patterns instead of antipatterns\nUsing examples to show the model a pattern to follow is more effective than using examples to show the model an antipattern to avoid.\n\u26d4 **Negative pattern** :\n| 0                          |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Example Don't end haikus with a question: Haiku are fun A short and simple poem Don't you enjoy them? |\n\u2705 **Positive pattern** :\n| 0                         |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Example Always end haikus with an assertion: Haiku are fun A short and simple poem A joy to write |\n### Use consistent formatting across examples\nMake sure that the structure and formatting of few-shot examples are the same to avoid responses with undesired formats. One of the primary objectives of adding few-shot examples in prompts is to show the model the response format. Therefore, it is essential to ensure a consistent format across all examples, especially paying attention to XML tags, white spaces, newlines, and example splitters.\n### Summary\n- Including prompt-response examples in the prompt helps the model learn how to respond.\n- Give the model examples of the patterns to follow instead of examples of patterns to avoid.\n- Experiment with the number of prompts to include. Depending on the model, too few examples are ineffective at changing model behavior. Too many examples cause the model to overfit.\n- Use consistent formatting across examples## Add contextual information\nYou can include in the prompt instructions and information that the model needs to solve a problem instead of assuming that the model has all of the required information. This contextual information helps the model understand the constraints and details of what you're asking for it to do.\nThe following example asks the model to give troubleshooting guidance for a router:\n| 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: What should I do to fix my disconnected wifi?

(gemini-pro) |\n### Summary\n- Include information (context) in the prompt that you want the model to use when generating a response.\n- Give the model instructions on how to use the contextual information.## Add prefixes\nA prefix is a word or phrase that you add to the prompt content that can serve several purposes, depending on where you put the prefix:\n- **Input prefix:** Adding a prefix to the input signals semantically meaningful parts of the input to the model. For example, the prefixes \"English:\" and \"French:\" demarcate two different languages.\n- **Output prefix:** Even though the output is generated by the model, you can add a prefix for the output in the prompt. The output prefix gives the model information about what's expected as a response. For example, the output prefix \"JSON:\" signals to the model that the output should be in JSON format.\n- **Example prefix:** In few-shot prompts, adding prefixes to the examples provides labels that the model can use when generating the output, which makes it easier to parse output content.\nIn the following example, \"Text:\" is the input prefix and \"The answer is:\" is the output prefix.\n| 0                                                            |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Classify the text as one of the following categories. - large - small Text: Rhino The answer is: large Text: Mouse The answer is: small Text: Snail The answer is: small Text: Elephant The answer is: Response: large (gemini-pro) |\n## Let the model complete partial input\nGenerative language models work like an advanced autocompletion tool. When you provide partial content, the model can provide the rest of the content or what it thinks is a continuation of that content as a response. When doing so, if you include any examples or context, the model can take those examples or context into account.\nThe following example provides a prompt with an instruction and an entity input:\n| 0                                                                    |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: For the given order, return a JSON object that has the fields cheeseburger, hamburger, fries, or drink, with the value being the quantity. Order: A burger and a drink. Response: ``` { \"cheeseburger\": 0, \"hamburger\": 1, \"fries\": 0, \"drink\": 1 } ``` (gemini-pro) |\nWhile the model did as prompted, writing out the instructions in natural language can sometimes be challenging and it leaves a lot to the model's interpretation. For example, a restaurants menu might contain many items. To reduce the size of the JSON response, you probably want to omit the items that weren't ordered. In this case, you can give an example and a response prefix and let the model complete it:\n| 0                                                                         |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Valid fields are cheeseburger, hamburger, fries, and drink. Order: Give me a cheeseburger and fries Output: ``` { \"cheeseburger\": 1, \"fries\": 1 } ``` Order: I want two burgers, a drink, and fries. Output: Response: ``` { \"hamburger\": 2, \"drink\": 1, \"fries\": 1 } ``` (gemini-pro) |\nNotice how \"cheeseburger\" was excluded from the output because it wasn't a part of the order.\nThe completion strategy can also help format the response. The following example prompts the model to create an essay outline:\n| 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Create an outline for an essay about hummingbirds.

(gemini-pro) |\n### Summary\n- If you give the model a partial input, the model completes that input based on any available examples or context in the prompt.\n- Having the model complete an input may sometimes be easier than describing the task in natural language.\n- Adding a partial answer to a prompt can guide the model to follow a desired pattern or format.## Break down prompts into simple components\nFor use cases that require complex prompts, you can help the model manage this complexity by breaking things down into simpler components.\n### Break down instructions\nInstead of having many instructions in one prompt, create one prompt per instruction. You can choose which prompt to process based on the user's input.\n### Chain prompts### Aggregate responses\nAggregation is when you want to perform different parallel tasks on different portions of the data and aggregate the results to produce the final output. For example, you can tell the model to perform one operation on the first part of the data, perform another operation on the rest of the data and aggregate the results.\n### Summary\n- Break down complex instructions into a prompt for each instruction and decide which prompt to  apply based on the user's input.\n- Break down multiple sequential steps into separate prompts and chain them such that the output  on the preceding prompt becomes the input of the following prompt.\n- Break down parallel tasks and aggregate the responses to produce the final output.## Experiment with different parameter values\nEach call that you send to a model includes parameter values that control how the model generates a response. The model can generate different results for different parameter values. Experiment with different parameter values to get the best values for the task. The parameters available for different models may differ. The most common parameters are the following:\n- Max output tokens\n- Temperature\n- Top-K\n- Top-P\n### Max output tokens\nSpecify a lower value for shorter responses and a higher value for longer responses.\n### Temperature\n`topP`\n`topK`\n`0`\nFor most use cases, try starting with a temperature of `0.2` . If the model returns a response that's too generic, too short, or the model gives a fallback response, try increasing the temperature.\n### Top-K\n`1`\n`3`\nFor each token selection step, the top-K tokens with the highest probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on top-P with the final token selected using temperature sampling.\nSpecify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses. The default top-K is `40` .\n### Top-P\n`0.5`\nSpecify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses. The default top-P is `0.95` .\n## Prompt iteration strategies\nPrompt design is an iterative process that often requires a few iterations before you get the desired response consistently. This section provides guidance on some things you can try when iterating on your prompts.\n### Use different phrasing\nUsing different words or phrasing in your prompts often yields different responses from the model even though they all mean the same thing. If you're not getting the expected results from your prompt, try rephrasing it.\n| 0                           |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Version 1: How do I bake a pie? Version 2: Suggest a recipe for a pie. Version 3: What's a good pie recipe? |\n### Switch to an analogous task\nIf you can't get the model to follow your instructions for a task, try giving it instructions for an analogous task that achieves the same result.\nThis prompt tells the model to categorize a book by using predefined categories.\n| 0                                                                                                                       |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Which category does The Odyssey belong to: thriller sci-fi mythology biography Response: The answer: mythology Explanations: The Odyssey is an epic poem in ancient Greek literature. It is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. The Odyssey is an epic poem that tells the story of Odysseus, a Greek hero who fought in the Trojan War and then spent ten years trying to return home to Ithaca. The Odyssey is a work of mythology. (text-bison@001) |\nThe response is correct, but the model didn't stay within the bounds of the options. You also want to model to just respond with one of the options instead of in a full sentence. In this case, you can rephrase the instructions as a multiple choice question and ask the model to choose an option.\n| 0                                                   |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt: Multiple choice problem: Which of the following options describes the book The Odyssey? Options: - thriller - sci-fi - mythology - biography Response: The answer is: mythology (text-bison@001) |\n### Change the order of prompt content\nThe order of the content in the prompt can sometimes affect the response. Try changing the content order and see how that affects the response.\n```\nVersion 1:\n[examples]\n[context]\n[input]\nVersion 2:\n[input]\n[examples]\n[context]\nVersion 3:\n[examples]\n[input]\n[context]\n```\n## Fallback responses\nA fallback response is a response returned by the model when either the prompt or the response triggers a safety filter. An example of a fallback response is \"I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model.\"\nIf the model responds with a fallback response, try increasing the temperature.\n## Things to avoid\n- Avoid relying on models to generate factual information.\n- Use with care on math and logic problems.\n## Task-specific guidance\nThis page provides general prompt design guidance.
