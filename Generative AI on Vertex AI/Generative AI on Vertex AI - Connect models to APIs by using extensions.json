Pre-GA products and features  may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA products and features may not be compatible with  other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) . Further, by using  Vertex AI Extensions, you agree to the Generative AI Preview [terms and conditions](/trustedtester/aitos) (\"Preview Terms\").\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are powerful at solving many types of problems. However, they are constrained by the following limitations:\n- They are frozen after training, leading to stale knowledge.\n- They can't query or modify external data.\nVertex AI Extensions (currently in [Private preview](/products#product-launch-stages) ) is a platform for enterprise extensions that addresses these shortcomings. With Vertex AI Extensions, you can create, deploy, and manage extensions that connect large language models to the APIs of external systems. These systems can provide LLMs with real-time data and perform data processing actions on their behalf.\nVertex AI Extensions is compatible with patterns like [ReAct](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/react-synergizing-reasoning-and-acting.html) and frameworks like [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started) . With Vertex AI Extensions, your LLMs can chain together extension actions to plan, reason, and complete complex tasks.\nTo learn more, see [Use-cases and benefits of Vertex AI Extensions](#use-cases-benefits) .

These systems can provide LLMs with real-time data and perform data processing actions on their behalf. The following are some of the possible use-cases:\n- Generate and execute code.\n- Query websites and synthesize information.\n- Perform index and power search of enterprise data sources.\n- Query and analyze data stores.\nVertex AI Extensions is compatible with patterns like [ReAct](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/react-synergizing-reasoning-and-acting.html) and frameworks like [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started) . With Vertex AI Extensions, your LLMs can chain together extension actions to plan, reason, and complete complex tasks. The following are some of the possible use-cases:\n- Create a presentation from a document.\n- Submit expenses for reimbursement.\n- Plan a trip and buy tickets.\n- Propose & execute responses to security incidents.\nVertex AI Extensions will provide the following benefits:\n- **Enterprise controls** : [IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permissions and security controls for access transparency (AXT), data residency (DRZ), customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK), and virtual private cloud security controls (VPC-SC).\n- **Performance guarantees** : Contractual agreements that your private data won't be leaked or used in model training, and that the platform delivers specific features and uptimes.\n- **Private extensions** : Authorized users in your organization or a trusted partner can use extensions to access sensitive internal data and actions, such as searching internal knowledge bases or completing HR actions.\n- **Google product integrations** : Integration with Google products like BigQuery, Vertex AI Search, and specialized models.## What's next\n- Sign up for the [Extensions Trusted Tester Program](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds-VygaqOe5z38ZCoIqf8ZS0BLBQ1WPOX-VbAnK2j-cAHF_Q/viewform) .", "guide": "Generative AI on Vertex AI"}
