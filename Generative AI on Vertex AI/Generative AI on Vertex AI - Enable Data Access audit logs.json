Data Access audit logs include \"admin read\" operations that read metadata or configuration information. They also include \"data read\" and \"data write\" operations that read or write user-provided data.\nAfter you enable Data Access audit logs for Vertex AI, to view the `data_access` log stream in the Google Cloud console, you need to be granted the Private Logs Viewer role (roles/logging.privateLogViewer) .\nTo learn more about Data Access logs, including how to enable and view the logs, see [Vertex AI audit logging information](/vertex-ai/docs/general/audit-logging) .\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn how to [tune a foundation model](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/tune-models) .\n- Learn about [responsible AI best practices and Vertex AI's safety filters](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/responsible-ai) .", "guide": "Generative AI on Vertex AI"}
