Data that contains hundreds of labeled examples is used to teach the model to mimic a desired behavior or task. Each labeled example demonstrates what you want the model to output during inference.\nWhen you run a supervised tuning job, the model learns additional parameters that help it encode the necessary information to perform the desired task or learn the desired behavior. These parameters are used during inference. The output of the tuning job is a new model that combines the newly learned parameters with the original model.\n", "content": "## Models that support supervised tuning\nThe following text foundation models support supervised tuning:\n- Text generation -`text-bison@002`and`text-bison-32k`\n- Text chat -`chat-bison@002`and`chat-bison-32k`\n- Code generation -`code-bison@002`and`code-bison-32k`\n- Code chat -`codechat-bison@002`and`codechat-bison-32k`\n- Text embeddings -`textembedding-gecko@001`( [preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) )## Workflow for supervised model tuning\nThe supervised model tuning workflow on Vertex AI includes the following steps:\n- Prepare your model tuning dataset.\n- Upload the model tuning dataset to a Cloud Storage bucket.\n- Create a supervised model tuning job.\nAfter model tuning completes, the tuned model is deployed to a Vertex AI endpoint. The name of the endpoint is the same as the name of the tuned model. Tuned models are available to select in Vertex AI Studio when you want to create a new prompt.\nTo learn about tuning a text model with supervised tuning, see [Tune text models by using supervised tuning](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/tune-text-models-supervised) .
