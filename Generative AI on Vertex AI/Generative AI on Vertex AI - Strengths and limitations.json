We recommend starting from the following prompts for images/videos and iterating from there for getting more specific descriptions. Image: \u201cCan you write a description about the image?\u201d Video: \u201cCan you write a description about what's happening in this video?\u201d |\n| Extrapolations    | Suggesting what else to see based on location, what might happen next/before/between images or videos, and enabling creative uses like writing stories based on visual inputs.                                         |\n## Current limitations of Gemini\nWhile powerful, Gemini has limitations. It can struggle with precise object location in images, long videos, and complex instructions. It's not suitable for medical use or chatbots.\n| Limitation      | Description                                                                                                            |\n|:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Spatial reasoning    | Can struggle with precise object/text localization in images. It may be less accurate in understanding rotated images.                                                                                 |\n| Counting      | Can only provide rough approximations of object counts, especially for obscured objects.                                                                                         |\n| Understanding longer videos | Can support videos as a separate modality (different from simply processing individual images). However, the model receives information from a non-contiguous set of image frames, not the continuous video itself (and no audio). Gemini also does not extract any information beyond 2 minutes of the video. To improve performance on videos with dense content, shorten your video so that the model captures a greater portion of the video content. |\n| Following complex instructions | Can struggle with tasks requiring multiple reasoning steps. Consider breaking down instructions or providing few-shot examples for better guidance.                                                                          |\n| Hallucinations     | Can sometimes extrapolate beyond what's actually in the image/video or generate incorrect content for extensive text parsing. Reducing temperature or requesting shorter descriptions can help mitigate this.                                                            |\n| Medical uses     | Not suitable for interpreting medical images (e.g., x-rays, CT scans) or providing medical advice.                                                                                      |\n| Multi-turn (multimodal) chat | Not trained for chatbot functionality or answering questions in a chatty tone, and can perform less effectively in multi-turn conversations.                                                                            |\n## Not supported by the current version\nGemini does not consider image metadata, and does not process audio from videos. Bounding box detection and object segmentation are also not supported by the current version of Gemini.\n| Item       | Description                 |\n|:------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Metadata      | The model does not consider image filenames or metadata.     |\n| Audio within videos   | The model does not receive or process any of the audio from video input. |\n| Bounding box object detection | Outputting bounding boxes for specific objects is not supported.   |\n| Object segmentation   | Generating a more fine-grained mask for an object's shape is not supported. |\n## What's next\nTo get started, see [Test multimodal prompts](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/send-multimodal-prompts)", "guide": "Generative AI on Vertex AI"}
