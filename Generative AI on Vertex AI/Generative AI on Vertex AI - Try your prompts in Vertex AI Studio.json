For more information, see [Pricing for Generative AI on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#generative_ai_models) and the [Generative AI on Vertex AI release notes](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/release-notes) .\nUse Vertex AI Studio to design, test, and customize your prompts sent to Google's [Gemini](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/overview) and [PaLM 2](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/language-model-overview) large language models (LLM). After an LLM processes your prompt, it sends you its response.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\nBefore you can try Vertex AI Studio, you must [Set up a project and a development environment](/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment) . Google Cloud organizes resources into projects. This lets you collect in one place related resources for a single application.\n## Test a language model from the prompt gallery\n- Go to the **Vertex AI Studio** page from the Vertex AI section in the Google Cloud console. [Vertex AI Studio](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative) \n- Click **Open** on the Language model option.\n- From the Language studio, navigate to the Prompt Gallery, and select **Open** on the`Transcript Summarization`prompt example. The prompt, model, and parameters are prefilled with the values from the sample prompt.\n- Click **Submit** to get a response from the test model. Scroll down to see all of the results.\n- To see different results, change the Model in the model drop-down, and adjust the parameters.## Design and test your prompt\nYou can create and test your prompts (inputs) for tasks that are relevant to your business use case, and generate responses. By adding inputs and outputs, the LLM is capable of learning in-context from the examples of responses.\nYou can create a prompt, which gives a precise instruction, and asks the LLM to complete a sentence for you or to answer one-time questions.\n- Go to the **Vertex AI Studio** page from the Vertex AI section in the Google Cloud console. [Vertex AI Studio](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative) \n- Click **Open** on the Language model option.\n- Click **Create Prompt** . An untitled prompt opens.\n- In the prompt box, add a clear and concise description of the task that you want the model to do.\n- As an example, ask the model to`Suggest a name for a flower shop that sells bouquets of dried flowers`.\n- Click **Submit** .\n- Responses appear in response box. If you want to view different results, adjust the parameters, and click **Submit** .## What's next\n- Learn about [designing text prompts](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/text/text-prompts) and [text chat prompts](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/chat/chat-prompts) .\n- Learn about [text embeddings](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings) .\n- Try to [tune a language foundation model](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-tuning) .\n- Learn about [responsible AI best practices](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/responsible-ai#recommended_practices) and [Vertex AI's safety filters](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/responsible-ai#safety_filters_and_attributes) .\n- Learn about [streaming responses from a model](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/streaming) .", "guide": "Generative AI on Vertex AI"}
