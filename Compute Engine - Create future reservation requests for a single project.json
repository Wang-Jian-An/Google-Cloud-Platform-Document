Pre-GA products and features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nThis document explains how to create single-project future reservation requests.\nIf Google Cloud approves your single-project future reservation request, then, at the start time specified in your request, Compute Engine automatically creates reservations that can only be consumed by virtual machine (VM) instances created in the same project.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\n- If you haven't already, review [how future reservations work](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#how-future-reservations-work) .\n- If you haven't already, set up authentication. [Authentication](/compute/docs/authentication) is the process by which your identity is verified for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to Compute Engine as follows.Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:\nWhen you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and   APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:```\ngcloud init\n``` **Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI  previously, make sure you have the latest version by running`gcloud components  update`.\n- [ Set a default region and zone](/compute/docs/gcloud-compute#set_default_zone_and_region_in_your_local_client) .\nTo use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:\n- ```\ngcloud init\n```\n### Required roles\nTo get the permissions that you need to create single-project future reservation requests,   ask your administrator to grant you the [Compute Future Reservation User ](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#compute.futureReservationUser) ( `roles/compute.futureReservationUser` ) IAM role on the project.    For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nThis predefined role contains     the permissions required to create single-project future reservation requests. To see the exact permissions that are   required, expand the **Required permissions** section:\nYou might also be able to get   these permissions  with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or  other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\n## Create a single-project future reservation request\nThis section explains how to create a single-project future reservation request.\n**Warning** : After a future reservation request is submitted, approved by Google Cloud, and past its lock time, you can delete the future reservation and its auto-created reservationsafter the end time of the future reservation's reservation period. Thus, before creating a future reservation request, make sure of the following:- Any existing reservations or future reservations in a project restrict the share settings of the future reservation requests you can create. To ensure that you can successfully create a future reservation request, and your request doesn't cause issues in other projects you share future reservations or reservations with, see [Restrictions](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#restrictions) .\n- You must commit to pay for the reserved resources that Compute Engine provisions for the entire reservation period, regardless if the auto-created reservations are used or not. For more information, see [Billing](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#billing) .\nTo consume an auto-created reservation for a future reservation, a VM must have [properties that exactly match](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-overview#requirements) that reservation. To specify the properties of the VMs that you want to request to reserve by creating a future reservation request, select one of the following methods:\n- Recommended: [Specify an instance template](#specify-instance-template) This section explains how you can use an existing [instance template](/compute/docs/instance-templates) to define the properties of a future reservation request. By using an instance template, you can define the properties of a future reservation and the VMs that can consume the auto-created reservations in the same place.\n- [Specify properties directly](#specify-vm-properties) This section explains how to directly define the properties of a future reservation request. This method requires you to manually ensure that the properties of your VMs and the auto-created reservations match \u2014any [mismatched properties prevent consumption](/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-reservation-consumption#mismatched-vm-properties) .\nAn auto-created reservation for a future reservation can be automatically consumed by any VMs with matching properties. If you want to avoid a VM to consume any of these auto-created reservations, see how to [create VMs without consuming reservations](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-consume#creating_instances_without_consuming_reservations) .\n### Specify an instance template\nYou can create a single-project future reservation by specifying an existing instance template using the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI, and REST.\n**Caution** : Before using an instance template to create a future reservation request, make sure of the following:- You must create your future reservation request in the same region and zone as the resources within the instance template. Any [regional](/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources#regionalresources) or [zonal resources](/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources#zoneresources) that are specified in an instance template\u2014such as a machine type or a disk\u2014restrict the use of the template to the locations where those resources are located. For example, if your instance template specifies an existing disk in the `us-central1-a` zone, then you must create your future reservation request in the same zone. Otherwise, creating the future reservation request fails.To check if an existing template specifies any resources that bind the template to a specific region or zone, [view the details of the template](/compute/docs/instance-templates/get-list-delete-instance-templates#get_information_about_an_instance_template) and look for references to regional or zonal resources inside of it.\n- After you create a future reservation request, you can't modify the future reservation request to override the template's VM properties or specify another template. Instead, you must [create a new future reservation request](/compute/docs/instances/manage-future-reservations#change-other-properties) with your desired updates.\nTo create a single-project future reservation request by specifying an instance template, follow these steps:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Reservations** page. [Go to Reservations](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/reservations) \n- Click the **Future reservations** tab.\n- Click add_box **Create future reservation** .The **Create a future reservation** page opens.\n- In the **Name** field, enter a name for your future reservation request.\n- In the **Prefix** field, enter a name prefix. The name of each auto-created reservation from this future reservation request starts with this prefix.To help you identify the auto-created reservations for this future reservation request, specifying an unique name prefix is recommended.\n- Optional: In the **Description** field, enter a description for your future reservation request.\n- In the **Region** field, select the region to reserve resources in.\n- In the **Zone** field, select the zone to reserve resources in.\n- In the **Start time** field, enter a start time for the reservation period. The start time can't be later than 1 year from the date and time at which you submit a future reservation request for review.Make sure to specify a [recommended value for the start time](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#recommended-start-time) to ensure that you have sufficient time before your future reservation enters its lock time.\n- In the **End time** field, enter an end time for the reservation period. The reservation period must last at least 24 hours.In the **Duration summary** section, you can see the length of the reservation period. To increase the likelihood that Google Cloud approves your future reservation request after submitting it for review, make sure to specify a [recommended value for the reservation period](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#recommended-minimum-reservation-period) .\n- In the **Share type** section, select **Local** (default).\n- In the **Number of VM instances** field, enter the total count of VMs that you want reserved for the period, VM configuration, and project(s) specified in this future reservation request.When calculating the amount of new reservations to create for an approved future reservation request shortly before the start time, Compute Engine subtracts any existing reservations that match the request from this total. For more information, see how Compute Engine [counts and provisions reserved resources](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#count-reserved-resources) . **Caution:** Make sure that you have sufficient quota for the resources that you're requesting to reserve. Otherwise, Google Cloud declines your future reservation request.\n- In the **Machine configuration** section, do the following:- To specify the properties of your VMs using an existing [instance template](/compute/docs/instance-templates) , select **Use instance template** .\n- In the **Instance template** field, select the instance template of your choice. If you select a regional instance template, you can only reserve resources within the region where the instance template is located.\n- In the **Auto-generated reservations auto-delete time** section, do one of the following:- To enable Compute Engine to automatically delete the auto-created reservations for your future reservation request, do the following: **Caution:** If the auto-delete option is enabled, all the auto-created reservations are deleted at the specified deletion time regardless if they're fully consumed or not.- Click the **Enable auto-delete** toggle to the on position (default).\n- Optional: In the **Auto-delete time** field, enter a new date and time when to delete the auto-created reservations. The date and time must be after the end time of the reservation period. If you leave this field empty, the auto-created reservations are deleted within 2 hours after the end time of the reservation period.\n- Otherwise, click the **Enable auto-delete** toggle to the off position.\n- Do one of the following:- To create a future reservation request and submit it for review to Google Cloud, click **Submit** . **Caution:** Make sure a future reservation request is ready for review before submitting it. After it is submitted, you can't revert back to drafting.\n- To create a drafting future reservation request, click **Save draft** .\n- To exit without saving, click **Cancel** .\nThe **Reservations** page opens. Creating the future reservation request can take up to a minute to complete.\nTo create a single-project future reservation request by specifying an instance template, use the [gcloud beta compute future-reservations create command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/future-reservations/create) with the `--source-instance-template` flag.\n```\ngcloud beta compute future-reservations create FUTURE_RESERVATION_NAME \\\n --auto-delete-auto-created-reservations \\\n --description=\"DESCRIPTION\" \\\n --name-prefix=NAME_PREFIX \\\n --planning-status=PLANNING_STATUS \\\n --project=PROJECT_ID \\\n --source-instance-template=projects/PROJECT_ID/LOCATION/instanceTemplates/INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME \\\n --start-time=START_TIME \\\n --end-time=END_TIME \\\n --total-count=TOTAL_COUNT \\\n --zone=ZONE\n```\nReplace the following:- ``: the name of the future reservation request to create.\n- ``: Optional.
