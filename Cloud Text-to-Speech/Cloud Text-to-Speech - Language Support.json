When using Polyglot with a custom voice model, each language creates a model.\nExample: A custom voice model is trained using `fr-FA` audio. This voice also needs to speak `en-GB` , `it-IT` , and `pt-BR` . The end result is four custom voice models. One `fr-FA` custom voice model in the original language and three models for the additional languages created with Polyglot.\nSamples of our Polyglot voices can be found on our [Polygot](/text-to-speech/docs/polyglot) page.\nPolyglot can transfer custom voice models to the following languages:\n- `ar-xa`\n- `da-dk`\n- `de-de`\n- `en-au`\n- `en-gb`\n- `en-in`\n- `en-sg`\n- `en-us`\n- `es-es`\n- `es-us`\n- `fi-fi`\n- `fil-ph`\n- `fr-ca`\n- `fr-fr`\n- `hi-in`\n- `it-it`\n- `ja-jp`\n- `ko-kr`\n- `pt-br`\n- `pt-pt`\n- `ru-ru`\n- `th-th`\n- `vi-vn`", "guide": "Cloud Text-to-Speech"}
