This feature allows you to train a custom voice model using your own studio-quality audio recordings to create a unique voice. You can the use your custom voice to synthesize audio using the Cloud Text-to-Speech API.\n## User-supplied training audio data\nCustom Voice delivers a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model that sounds as similar to your supplied audio data as possible. Google will send you a script for the voice recordings after your use case is approved. We suggest that you select and hire a voice actor who represents the custom voice you're aiming for. You need to record studio-quality audio with your voice actor to use as training data (see the [training data requirements page](/text-to-speech/custom-voice/docs/training-data) for more information). If your training data doesn't pass Google's internal quality checks, you might need to re-record or re-submit the data after fixing the identified issues.\n## Model training\nIt takes Google several weeks to train your custom voice model.\n## Deployment\nAfter training, Google will deploy the custom voice model to projects of your choosing.\n## What's next\n- Implement the Custom Voice feature using our [quickstart](/text-to-speech/custom-voice/ga/docs/quickstart) .", "guide": "Cloud Text-to-Speech"}
