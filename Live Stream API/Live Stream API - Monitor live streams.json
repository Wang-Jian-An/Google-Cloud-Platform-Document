You can find the list of Live Stream API metrics at [GoogleCloud metrics](/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp) .\n", "content": "## View Cloud Monitoring metrics\nTo view the metrics for a monitored resource by using the Metrics Explorer, do the following:\n- In the navigation panel of the Google Cloud console, select **Monitoring** , and then select **Metrics explorer** : [Go to Metrics explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/metrics-explorer) \n- In the **Metric** element, expand the **Select a metric** menu,  enter`Live Stream API Channel`in the filter bar, and then use the submenus to select a specific resource type and metric:- In the **Active resources** menu, select **Live Stream API Channel** .\n- To select a metric, use the **Active metric categories** and **Active metrics** menus.\n- Click **Apply** .\n- Configure how the data is viewed. For example, you can plot the chart for a specific channel by entering`channel_id = my-channel`in the **Filters** field.For more information about configuring a chart, see [Select metrics when using Metrics Explorer.](/monitoring/charts/metrics-selector) ## Convert the input stream bitrate unit\nYou can use the `channel/received_bytes_count` metric to monitor your input stream bitrate. By default, the unit of `channel/received_bytes_count` is bytes per second to be consistent with other Google Cloud metrics.\nFollow the steps below to change the unit to a different bitrate unit such as `mbps` :\n- In the Metrics Explorer **Configuration** tab, set the **Resource Type** field to **Live Stream API Channel** and the **Metric** field to **Receivedbytes count** .\n- Select the **MQL** tab.\n- Attach a scale function to the end of the current query:```\nfetch livestream.googleapis.com/Channel\n| metric 'livestream.googleapis.com/channel/received_bytes_count'\n| align rate(1m)\n| every 1m\n| scale(\"Mbit/s\")\n```\n- Click **RUN QUERY** to replot the chart with the `mbps` unit.\nFor more information about MQL, see [Using the Query Editor](/monitoring/mql/query-editor) .", "guide": "Live Stream API"}
