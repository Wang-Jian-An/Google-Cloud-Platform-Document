To set up workforce identity federation, see the following guides:\n- [Configure workforce identity federation with Azure AD and sign in users](/iam/docs/workforce-sign-in-azure-ad) \n- [Configure workforce identity federation with Okta and sign in users](/iam/docs/workforce-sign-in-okta) \n- [Configure workforce identity federation on an IdP that supports OIDC or SAML](/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation) ", "content": "## Before you begin\n- You must have a Google Cloud organization set up.\n- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:```\ngcloud init\n``` **Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI  previously, make sure you have the latest version by running`gcloud components  update`.## Manage pools\nThis section shows you how to manage workforce identity pools.\n### Create a pool\nTo create a workforce pool, execute the following command:\n**    Preview     ** This feature is subject to the \"Pre-GA Offerings Terms\" in the General Service Terms section   of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) .     Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .To create the workforce identity pool, do the following:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Workforce Identity Pools** page: [Go to Workforce Identity Pools](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/workforce-identity-pools) \n- Click **Create pool** and do the following:- In **Name** , enter the name of the pool. **Pool ID** is automatically derived from the name as you type.\n- Optional: To update the ID, click **Edit** .\n- Optional: In **Description** , enter a description of the pool.\n- **Session duration** is set by default.
