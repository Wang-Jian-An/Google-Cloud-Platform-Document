Because of this risk, you might want to test allow policy changes before making them to confirm that they won't disrupt anyone's work.\nYou can use Policy Simulator to see how a change to an allow policy might impact a principal's access before you commit to making the change. Testing these changes helps ensure that the changes you're making won't cause a principal to lose access that they need.\nTo learn more about Policy Simulator, see the [Policy Simulatoroverview](/policy-intelligence/docs/iam-simulator-overview) in the Policy Intelligence documentation", "content": ".", "guide": "IAM"}
