For example, you can use [Google Admin Toolbox HAR Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/) , which provides instructions for generating a HAR file and the tools to upload and analyze it.\n **Important:** If you are requesting the HAR file from your users, request that they clean up any personally identifiable information (PII) and cookies from the HAR file before sending it.\nTo inspect the SAML IdP response, perform following steps:- Locate the value of`SAMLResponse`request parameter in the HAR file that is logged against the URL with path`/signin-callback`.\n- Decode it using a tool of your choice\u2014for example, you can use [Google Admin Toolbox Encode/Decode](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode/) .\nTo inspect the OIDC IdP response, perform following steps:- Look for the`id_token`request parameter in the HAR file that is logged against a URL with path`/signin-callback`.\n- Decode it using a JWT debugging tool of your choice.\nTo inspect the response from your IdP when using the gcloud CLI, copy the contents of the file that you passed in the `--credential-source-file` flag when running the `gcloud iam workforce-pools create-cred-config` command, then perform the steps below:\nDecode the SAML IdP response using a tool of your choice\u2014for example, you can use [Google Admin Toolbox Encode/Decode](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode/) .\nDecode the OIDC IdP response using a JWT debugging tool of your choice.\n## Review logs\nTo determine whether Google Cloud is communicating with your IdP and review transaction information, you can inspect the Cloud Audit Logs logs. To see log examples, see [Example audit logs](/iam/docs/audit-logging/examples-workforce-identity) .\n## Workforce pool and provider management errors\nThis section provides suggestions to fix common errors that you might encounter when managing pools and providers.\n### Permission denied\nThis error occurs when the user attempting to configure workforce identity federation doesn't have the role IAM Workforce Pool Admin ( `roles/iam.workforcePoolAdmin` ).\n### INVALID_ARGUMENT: Missing OIDC web single sign-on config\nThe following error occurs when the `web-sso-response-type` and `web-sso-assertion-claims-behavior` fields are not set when creating an OIDC workforce identity pool provider:\n```\nERROR: (gcloud.iam.workforce-pools.providers.create-oidc) INVALID_ARGUMENT: Missing OIDC web single sign-on config.\n```\nTo resolve this error, follow the steps in the [Create a provider](/iam/docs/manage-workforce-identity-pools-providers#create_a_provider) section to set the fields appropriately when you create the OIDC workforce identity pool provider.\n### Rate limit exceeded, please try again later\nThis error occurs when you have reached your quota limit for workforce pool resources. Contact your Google Cloud account representative to request a quota increase.\n## Sign-in errors\nThis section provides suggestions to fix common errors that a workforce identity federation user might encounter when they sign in.\n### Common sign-in errors\nThis error occurs when the [attribute condition](/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-conditions) that is set on the workforce identity pool provider was not met.\nFor example, consider the following attribute condition:\n```\n'gcp-users' in assertion.attributes.groups\n```\n```\n'gcp-users' in assertion.groups\n```\nIn this case, you see the error if the list of groups sent in the `groups` attribute by your identity provider (IdP) doesn't contain `gcp-users` .\nTo resolve this error, perform the following steps:\n- [Describe the provider](/iam/docs/manage-workforce-identity-pools-providers#describe_a_provider) that was used to sign in, and check that the `attributeCondition` is correct. For information on operations that are supported in conditions, see the [Language Definition](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md) .\n- Follow the steps in [inspect the IdP response](#inspect-idp-response) to see the attributes that are returned by the IdP, and confirm if the attribute condition is well-formed and accurate.\n- Sign in to your IdP's admin console, and check if the IdP attributes referenced in the attribute condition are set up correctly. If necessary, consult your IdP's documentation.This error occurs for a SAML workforce identity pool provider when the attribute specified in the error message is expected to be a single-valued STRING, but it is mapped to a list in the [attribute mapping](/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-mappings) .\nFor example, consider a SAML workforce identity pool provider that has the attribute mapping, `attribute.role=assertion.attributes.userRole` . In a SAML assertion, an `Attribute` can have multiple `AttributeValue` tags as shown in the example that follows. Thus, all SAML attributes are considered lists, so `assertion.attributes.userRole` is a list.\n```\n<saml:Attribute Name=\"userRole\">\u00a0 \u00a0 <saml:AttributeValue>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 security-admin\u00a0 \u00a0 </saml:AttributeValue>\u00a0 \u00a0 <saml:AttributeValue>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 user\u00a0 \u00a0 </saml:AttributeValue></saml:Attribute>\n```\nIn this example, you might see the following error:\n```\nThe mapped attribute 'attribute.role' must be of type STRING\n```\nTo resolve this issue, perform the following steps:\n- [Describe the provider](/iam/docs/manage-workforce-identity-pools-providers#describe_a_provider) that was used to sign in, and identify the IdP attribute that is set in the `attributeMapping` . Check the attribute against the attribute presented in the error message. In the previous example, an IdP attribute called `userRole` is mapped to the `role` attribute and the `role` attribute appears in the error sample above.\n- Follow guidance below to update the attribute mapping: **Note:** Only `google.groups` accepts a list.- If the attribute that causes the error is list valued, identify an alternative, stable, string-valued attribute. Then, update the attribute mapping to use it by referencing its first item. For the previous example, if `myRole` was identified as the alternative single-valued IdP attribute, then, the attribute mapping would be:```\nattribute.role=assertion.attributes.myRole[0]\n```\n- Alternatively, if the attribute is known to be single-valued, update the attribute mapping to use the first item from the list. For the previous example, if `userRole` contains only one role, you can use the following mapping:```\nattribute.role=assertion.attributes.userRole[0]\n```\n- To derive a single-valued, stable identifier from the list, see [Language Definition](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md) and update your attribute mapping accordingly.See the [inspect the IdP response](#inspect-idp-response) section to see the response that is returned by the IdP.\nThis error occurs when the required claim `google.subject` couldn't be mapped using the [attribute mapping](/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-mappings) that you set in your workforce identity pool provider configuration.\nTo resolve this error, perform the following steps:\n- [Describe the provider](/iam/docs/manage-workforce-identity-pools-providers#describe_a_provider) , and inspect the `attributeMapping` . Identify the mapping that is configured for `google.subject` . If the mapping is not correct, update the workforce identity pool provider.\n- See the [inspect the IdP response](#inspect-idp-response) section to see the response returned by the IdP. Inspect the value of the attribute from IdP response that is mapped to `google.subject` in your attribute mappings.If the value is empty or incorrect, login to your IdP's admin console, and inspect the configured attributes. For the attributes, check if your affected user has corresponding data in your IdP. Update your IdP configuration to correct the attributes or user information accordingly.\n- Retry sign-in.This error occurs when either the request wasn't received as expected or it was malformed.\nTo resolve this error, perform the following steps:\n- Follow the steps in [Inform your users how to sign in](/iam/docs/workforce-console-sso#inform-users) section to verify if you are following the correct steps to sign in.\n- Compare your workforce identity pool provider configuration with your IdP configuration.\n### OIDC sign-in errors\nThis section provides suggestions to fix OIDC specific errors that a workforce identity federation user might encounter when they sign in.\nThis error occurs when an OIDC workforce identity pool provider is unable to reach the OIDC discovery document or JWKS URI.\nTo resolve this error, perform the following steps:\n- [Describe the provider](/iam/docs/manage-workforce-identity-pools-providers#describe_a_provider) , and inspect the configured `issuerUri` . Construct the discovery document URL by appending `/.well-known/openid-configuration` to your issuer URI. For example, if your `issuerUri` is `https://example.com` , the discovery document URL would be `https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration` .\n- Open the discovery document URL in an incognito browsing window.- If the URL doesn't open or the browser displays a `404` error, consult your IdP's documentation to identify the correct issuer URI. If necessary, update the `issuerUri` in your workforce identity federation pool provider.If your IdP is running on premises, consult your IdP's documentation to provision it for access over the internet.\n- If the URL opens, check for the following conditions:- Check that the URL doesn't redirect too many times before serving the discovery document. If it does, consult with your IdP's administrator to remedy the issue.\n- Check the IdP response time. Consult with your IdP administrator to reduce the response latency.\n- The opened discovery document should be in the [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format.\n- Look for a `jwks_uri` field in the JSON.- Verify that the associated URL value also opens.\n- Verify that the URL satisfies the conditions as described earlier in this guide.\n- Retry sign-in.\n### SAML sign-in errors\nThis section provides suggestions to fix SAML specific errors that a workforce identity federation user might encounter when they sign in.\nThis error occurs for a SAML workforce identity pool provider when the signature on the IdP response cannot be verified using any of the X.509 certificates provided in the IdP metadata XML that you configured in your workforce identity pool provider. A common cause of this error is that the verification certificate on your IdP was rotated, but you did not update the workforce identity pool provider configuration with the latest IdP metadata XML file.\nTo resolve this error, perform the following steps:\n- Optional: follow the steps in [inspect the IdP response](#inspect-idp-response) to see the response returned by the IdP and locate the `X509Certificate` field in it. [Describe the provider](/iam/docs/manage-workforce-identity-pools-providers#describe_a_provider) that you used to sign in, and inspect the `X509Certificate` field present in the `idpMetadataXml` value that is set on workforce identity pool provider. Compare the certificate with the one seen in the response returned by your IdP. The certificates must match.\n- Login to your IdP's admin console, and download the latest metadata XML.\n- Update the workforce identity pool provider with the downloaded IdP metadata XML.\n- Retry sign-in.This error occurs for a SAML workforce identity pool provider when the IdP response contains an incorrect value for the `Recipient` field on the `SubjectConfirmationData` tag.\nTo resolve this error, update the `Recipient URL` / `Redirect URL` or the equivalent field in your IdP's configuration to use the redirect URL described in the [Set up redirect URLs in your IdP](/iam/docs/workforce-console-sso#set-up-redirect) , and retry sign-in.\nFollow the steps in [inspect the IdP response](#inspect-idp-response) to see the response returned by the IdP, and confirm that the `Recipient` field is correct.\nFor example, for the workforce identity pool provider `locations/global/workforcePools/example-pool/providers/example-provider` , the `Recipient` containing the redirect URL appears in the IdP's SAML response as shown below:\n```\n<SubjectConfirmationData Recipient=\"https://auth.cloud.google/signin-callback/locations/global/workforcePools/example-pool/providers/example-provider\"\n```\nThis error occurs for a SAML workforce identity pool provider when the IdP response contains an incorrect value for the `Destination` field on the `Response` tag.\nTo resolve this error, update the `Destination URL` / `Redirect URL` or the equivalent field in your IdP's configuration to use the redirect URL described in [Set up redirect URLs in your IdP](/iam/docs/workforce-console-sso#set-up-redirect) .\nFollow the steps in [inspect the IdP response](#inspect-idp-response) to see the response returned by the IdP and confirm that the `Destination` field is correct.\nFor example, for a workforce identity pool provider `locations/global/workforcePools/example-pool/providers/example-provider` , the `Destination` containing redirect URL would appear in the IdP's SAML response as follows:\n```\n<Response Destination=\"https://auth.cloud.google/signin-callback/locations/global/workforcePools/example-pool/providers/example-provider\"\n```\nThis error occurs when the SAML response received from your IdP doesn't contain the `NameId` field or it has an empty value.\nTo resolve this error, consult your IdP documentation to configure it to send the `NameID` which is the subject of a SAML assertion, typically the user who is being authenticated.\n**Note:** `NameID` is required even if you decide to map a different attribute to `google.subject` in the attribute mapping.\nFollow the steps in [inspect the IdP response](#inspect-idp-response) to see the response returned by the IdP and the `NameID` that is set on it.\nThis error occurs when the `AudienceRestriction` tags in the SAML response from your IdP doesn't set an `Audience` tag with value that represented the entity ID of the workforce identity pool provider.\nTo resolve this error, perform the following steps:\n- Consult your IdP documentation on how to configure the audience in the `AudienceRestriction` tags that it sends in the SAML response. Typically, the audience is configured by setting up `Entity ID` or `Audience` field in your IdP configuration. See [Create a workforce identity pool provider's](/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation#saml) SAML section to see the value `SP Entity ID` that should be set.\n- After updating your IdP configuration, retry sign-in.\nFollow the steps in [inspect the IdP response](#inspect-idp-response) to see the response returned by the IdP and the `AudienceRestriction` s that are set on it.", "guide": "IAM"}
