Each member of a Google group inherits the Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles granted to that group. This inheritance means that you can use a group's membership to manage users' roles instead of granting IAM roles to individual users.\n**Note:** You can't add [Google-managed service accounts](/iam/docs/service-account-types#google-managed) to Google groups unless the [external members](https://support.google.com/a/answer/167097#zippy=%2Ccan-external-users-participate-in-groups) option is turned on.\nYou can create and manage groups for your organization in the Google Cloud console.\n", "content": "## Required permissions\nYou need the following permissions to manage groups in the Google Cloud console.\n[](None)\n### Group permissions\nTo create, view, edit, and delete groups, in the Google Cloud console or elsewhere, you need the appropriate group permissions. These permissions are managed by Google Workspace, not IAM. To gain these permissions, contact your Google Workspace administrator.\nTo learn about group permissions, see [Set who can view, post, &moderate](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/2464975) .\n### IAM permissions\nTo get the permissions that you need to use the Google Cloud console to manage groups,   ask your administrator to grant you the  following IAM roles on the organization:\n- [Organization Viewer ](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#resourcemanager.organizationViewer) (`roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer`)\n- To view group membership change logs: [Logs Viewer ](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#logging.viewer) (`roles/logging.viewer`)\nFor more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nYou might also be able to get  the required permissions through [custom  roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined  roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\n## Viewing groups\nTo view the Google groups in your organization that you have access to, follow these steps:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Groups** page. [Go to the Groups page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/groups) \n- Select the organization whose groups you want to view.\nThe Google Cloud console displays all the groups in your organization that you can access.\n**Note:** To check whether a group has access to your project and its resources, see [Viewing current access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#viewing-console) .\n## Creating a group\nTo create a group, follow these steps:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Groups** page.

To manage these features, you need to open the group in Google Groups.\nTo open a group in Google Groups, follow these steps:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Groups** page.

For example, it will generate audit logs when someone adds a user to your organization or when someone removes a user from a group. You can view and manage these logs in Cloud Logging.\nTo learn how to enable data sharing and how to view and manage Google Workspace audit logs, see [View and manage audit logs forGoogle Workspace](/logging/docs/audit/configure-gsuite-audit-logs) .\n## What's next\n- Learn how to [grant, change, and revoke access for principals](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) , including Google groups.\n- Review other ways to [create groups](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33343) .", "guide": "IAM"}
