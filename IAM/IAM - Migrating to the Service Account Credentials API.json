{"title": "IAM - Migrating to the Service Account Credentials API", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/migrating-to-credentials-api", "abstract": "# IAM - Migrating to the Service Account Credentials API\nThe [Service Account Credentials API](/iam/docs/reference/credentials/rest) creates short-lived credentials for Identity and Access Management (IAM) service accounts. You can also use this API to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), as well as blobs of binary data that contain other types of tokens.\nThe [IAM API](/iam/docs/reference/rest) also contains methods for signing JWTs and binary blobs. As of July 1, 2020, these methods are deprecated in the REST API and in all [client libraries](/iam/docs/write-policy-client-libraries) for the IAM API. Also, if you use the Google Cloud CLI to sign JWTs, you might need to add a new claim to the JWT Claims Set. You can still use the deprecated methods, but they don't support advanced features like [HTTPrequest batching](https://developers.google.com/people/v1/batch) . We encourage you to migrate to the Service Account Credentials API instead.\nCompared to the IAM API, the Service Account Credentials API provides more flexibility for the expiration time of signed JWTs. In addition, the Service Account Credentials API adds multiple new API methods to generate impersonation tokens.\nThis page explains how to update your existing code to use the Service Account Credentials API. If you have feedback on this change, you can [complete the feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbtyMsPmVVHZjM2QH0jQLy3bteyd306EjJyW7OtU4Zeg-9yw/viewform) . You can also use the email address [iam-sign-deprecation-public@google.com](mailto:iam-sign-deprecation-public@google.com) to request support and provide detailed feedback.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\n- Enable the Service Account Credentials API. [Enable the API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=iamcredentials.googleapis.com&redirect=https://console.cloud.google.com) ## Enabling audit logs\nIf you want to receive [audit logs](/iam/docs/audit-logging) for requests to sign JWTs and blobs, you must [enable Data Access audit logs](/logging/docs/audit/configure-data-access) for the IAM API. Enabling Data Access audit logs for the IAM API also enables these audit logs for the Service Account Credentials API.\nThere are a few notable differences between the log entries that each API generates:\n| Differences for audit log entries | Differences for audit log entries.1                                                                                          |\n|:------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Method name       | IAM API The method name (protoPayload.methodName) is one of the following: google.iam.admin.v1.SignBlob google.iam.admin.v1.SignJwt Service Account Credentials API The method name is one of the following: SignBlob SignJwt                                          |\n| Request type      | IAM API The request type (protoPayload.request.@type) is one of the following: type.googleapis.com/google.iam.admin.v1.SignBlobRequest type.googleapis.com/google.iam.admin.v1.SignJwtRequest Service Account Credentials API The request type is one of the following: type.googleapis.com/google.iam.credentials.v1.SignBlobRequest type.googleapis.com/google.iam.credentials.v1.SignJwtRequest |\n| Service name      | IAM API The service name (protoPayload.serviceName) is iam.googleapis.com.

This change will not affect commands to sign blobs.\n**If you use the gcloud CLI to sign JWTs, you must follow these stepsbefore July 1, 2021:**\n- Check whether you include the expiration time ( `exp` ) claim in the JWT Claims Set.If you already include this claim, you do not need to make any changes. You can skip the remaining steps.If you do not include this claim, continue to the next step.\n- Check whether you use the signed JWT to authenticate with Google APIs, or with another API that requires the `exp` claim.If you omit this claim, the IAM API automatically sets it to 1 hour in the future. In contrast, the Service Account Credentials API does not set this field automatically.If you are sure that you do not need the `exp` claim, you do not need to make any changes. You can skip the remaining steps.If you know that you need the `exp` claim, or if you aren't sure, continue to the next step.\n- Update your code for creating JWTs so that it adds the `exp` claim to the JWT Claims Set.You can set the `exp` claim up to 1 hour in the future.## Checking quotas\nQuota for the Service Account Credentials API is separate from quota for the IAM API. If you have received a quota increase to sign JWTs and blobs with the IAM API, you might also need to request an increase for the Service Account Credentials API.\n**Note:** Most Google Cloud customers use the default quota for signing JWTs and blobs. If you use the default quota, you do not need to read this section.\nTo view your quota and actual usage for both APIs, and to request a quota increase if necessary, do the following:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Quotas** page. [Go to the Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/quotas) \n- Select a project. You can click a recent project, or you can click **Selectproject** to search all of your projects.\n- In the **Filter table** text box above the table, enter `Sign requests per minute` , then select the value that appears.\n- In the **Filter table** text box, select **OR** from the drop-down list.\n- In the **Filter table** text box, enter `Generate credentials` , then select the value that appears.The Google Cloud console shows your current usage for signing JWTs and blobs over the past minute; your peak usage per minute over the past 7 days; and your current quota, which appears in the **Limit** column.\n- Compare the quotas for each row in the table, and ensure that your quota for the Service Account Credentials API is higher than your 7-day peak usage of the IAM API.\n- Optional: If your quota for the Service Account Credentials API is too low, select the checkbox for the Service Account Credentials API, then click **Editquotas** . Complete the form to request a quota increase.\n- Repeat these steps for each project where you use the IAM API to sign JWTs and blobs.## What's next\n- Find out how to [create a signed JWT](/iam/docs/creating-short-lived-service-account-credentials#sa-credentials-jwt) or [create a signed binary blob](/iam/docs/creating-short-lived-service-account-credentials#sa-credentials-blob) with the Service Account Credentials REST API.\n- Get details about the [REST API for the Service Account Credentials API](/iam/docs/reference/credentials/rest) .\n- Understand [quotas and limits for IAM](/iam/quotas) .", "guide": "IAM"}
