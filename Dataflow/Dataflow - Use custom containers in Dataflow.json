Custom containers are supported for pipelines that use Dataflow [Runner v2](/dataflow/docs/runner-v2) .\nWhen Dataflow starts up worker VMs, it uses Docker container images to launch containerized SDK processes on the workers. By default, a pipeline uses a prebuilt [Apache Beam image](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=apache%2Fbeam&type=image) . However, you can provide a custom container image for your Dataflow job. When you specify a custom container image, Dataflow launches workers that pull the specified image.\nYou might use a custom container for the following reasons:\n- Preinstall pipeline dependencies to reduce worker start time.\n- Preinstall pipeline dependencies that are not available in public repositories.\n- Preinstall pipeline dependencies when access to public repositories is turned off. Access might be turned off for security reasons.\n- Prestage large files to reduce worker start time.\n- Launch third-party software in the background.\n- Customize the execution environment.\nFor more information about custom containers in Apache Beam, see the [Apache Beam custom container guide](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runtime/environments/) . For examples of Python pipelines that use custom containers, see [Dataflow custom containers](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/tree/main/dataflow/custom-containers) .\n", "content": "## Next steps\n- [Build custom container images](/dataflow/docs/guides/build-container-image) \n- [Build multi-architecture container images](/dataflow/docs/guides/multi-architecture-container) \n- [Run a Dataflow job in a custom container](/dataflow/docs/guides/run-custom-container) \n- [Troubleshoot custom containers](/dataflow/docs/guides/troubleshoot-custom-container)", "guide": "Dataflow"}
