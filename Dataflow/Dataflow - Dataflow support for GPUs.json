{"title": "Dataflow - Dataflow support for GPUs", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/gpu/gpu-support", "abstract": "# Dataflow - Dataflow support for GPUs\n**Note:** The following considerations apply to this GA offering:- Jobs that use GPUs incur charges as specified in the Dataflow [pricing page](/dataflow/pricing) .\n- To use GPUs, your Dataflow job must use [Dataflow Runner v2](/dataflow/docs/runner-v2) .\nThis page provides background information on how GPUs work with Dataflow, including information about prerequisites and supported GPU types.\nUsing GPUs in Dataflow jobs lets you accelerate some data processing tasks. GPUs can perform certain computations faster than CPUs. These computations are usually numeric or linear algebra, often used in image processing and machine learning use cases. The extent of performance improvement varies by the use case, type of computation, and amount of data processed.\n", "content": "## Prerequisites for using GPUs in Dataflow- To use GPUs with your Dataflow job, you must use Runner v2.\n- Dataflow runs user code in worker VMs inside a Docker container.  These worker VMs run [Container-Optimized OS](/container-optimized-os/docs) .  For Dataflow jobs to use GPUs, you need the following prerequisites:- GPU drivers are installed on worker VMs and accessible to the Docker  container. For more information, see [Install GPU drivers](/dataflow/docs/gpu/use-gpus#drivers) .\n- GPU libraries required by your pipeline, such as [NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-accelerated-libraries) or the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) ,  are installed in the custom container image. For more information, see [Configure your container image](/dataflow/docs/gpu/use-gpus#container-image) .- Because GPU containers are typically large, to avoid [running out of disk space](/dataflow/docs/guides/common-errors#no-space-left) , increase the default [boot disk size](/dataflow/docs/reference/pipeline-options#worker-level_options) to 50 gigabytes or more.\n## Pricing\nJobs using GPUs incur charges as specified in the Dataflow [pricing page](/dataflow/pricing) .\n## Availability\nThe following GPU types are supported with Dataflow:\n| GPU type   | worker_accelerator string |\n|:--------------------|:----------------------------|\n| NVIDIA\u00ae L4   | nvidia-l4     |\n| NVIDIA\u00ae A100 40\u00a0GB | nvidia-tesla-a100   |\n| NVIDIA\u00ae A100 80\u00a0GB | nvidia-a100-80gb   |\n| NVIDIA\u00ae Tesla\u00ae T4 | nvidia-tesla-t4    |\n| NVIDIA\u00ae Tesla\u00ae P4 | nvidia-tesla-p4    |\n| NVIDIA\u00ae Tesla\u00ae V100 | nvidia-tesla-v100   |\n| NVIDIA\u00ae Tesla\u00ae P100 | nvidia-tesla-p100   |\n| NVIDIA\u00ae Tesla\u00ae K80 | nvidia-tesla-k80   |\nFor more information about each GPU type, including performance data, see [Compute Engine GPU platforms](/compute/docs/gpus) .\nFor information about available regions and zones for GPUs, see [GPU regions and zones availability](/compute/docs/gpus/gpu-regions-zones) in the Compute Engine documentation.\n## What's next\n- See an example of a [developer workflow for building pipelines that use GPUs](/dataflow/docs/gpu/develop-with-gpus) .\n- Learn how to [run an Apache Beam pipeline on Dataflow with GPUs](/dataflow/docs/gpu/use-gpus) .\n- Work through [Processing Landsat satellite images with GPUs](/dataflow/docs/samples/satellite-images-gpus) .", "guide": "Dataflow"}
