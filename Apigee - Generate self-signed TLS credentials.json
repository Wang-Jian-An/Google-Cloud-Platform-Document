For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\n**More Information** For more information, see:- [About environments and environment groups](/apigee/docs/api-platform/fundamentals/environments-overview) \nThis topic explains how to create self-signed TLS certificates for use in an environment configuration. This information is intended for trial or testing purposes only.\n**Warning:** Self-signed certificates are not recommended for production. Only consider using them for development, trial, or testing purposes.\nThe runtime ingress gateway (the gateway that handles API proxy traffic) requires a TLS certificate/key pair. For this quickstart installation, you can use self-signed credentials. In the following steps, [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) is used to generate the credentials.\n- Be sure that you are in the`` `/hybrid-files`directory.  It was suggested in the installation quickstart that you create a`hybrid-files`directory to contain files that you create. Your file structure may differ from the suggested  structure.\n- Execute the following command from inside`hybrid-files`directory, where`./certs`is the directory containing your certificates.```\nopenssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout ./certs/keystore.key -out \\\n ./certs/keystore.pem -subj '/CN=mydomain.net' -days 3650\n```This command creates a self-signed certificate/key pair that you can use for the  quickstart installation. The CN `mydomain.net` can be any value you wish for  the self-signed credentials.\n- Check to make sure the files are in the`./certs`directory:```\nls ./certs\n keystore.pem\n keystore.key\n```Where `keystore.pem` is the self-signed TLS certificate file and `keystore.key` is the key file", "content": ".", "guide": "Apigee"}
