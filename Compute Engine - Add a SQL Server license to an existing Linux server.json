This document describes how to use SQL Server on a Linux VM by doing the following:\n- [Add SQL Server license metadata to a boot disk](#add-sql-server-license) \n- [Install SQL Server on Linux](#install-sql-server-on-linux) ", "content": "## Billing\nAfter adding a license string to the Linux VM's boot disk, you are billed according to the pricing of [SQL Server images](/compute/disks-image-pricing#sql_server_pricing) .\n## Limitations\n- You can only install SQL Server on the following Linux distributions:- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)\n- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)\n- Ubuntu\n## Add a SQL Server license to a Linux Server\nSQL Server license metadata on a boot disk allows Google Cloud to accurately track, bill, and report on SQL Server license usage. This metadata is required when using PAYG SQL Server licenses. Add a SQL Server license to an existing boot disk using the following procedure:\n**Caution:** After you add a license to a VM, you cannot remove the license from the VM.\n- Identify the license you want to add to a VM. For SQL Server, the license needs to match both the version and edition you want to run. For the list of valid SQL Server license strings, see the **License strings** tab in the [operating system details for SQL Server](/compute/docs/images/os-details#sql_server) document.\n- Stop the VM:```\ngcloud compute instances stop VM_NAME\n```Replace `` with the name of the VM instance to stop.\n- Identify the boot disk:```\ngcloud compute instances describe VM_NAME\n```Replace `` with the name of the VM.\n- Verify that the output is similar to the following:```\ndisks:\n- autoDelete: true\n boot: true\n deviceName: BOOT_DISK_NAME\n diskSizeGb: '20'\n guestOsFeatures:\n - type: UEFI_COMPATIBLE\n index: 0\n interface: SCSI\n kind: compute#attachedDisk\n licenses:\n - BOOT_DISK_LICENSE_STRING\n mode: READ_WRITE\n source: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/PROJECT_NAME/zones/ZONE/disks/BOOT_DISK_NAME\n type: PERSISTENT\n```\n- Detach the boot disk:```\ngcloud compute instances detach-disk VM_NAME --disk=BOOT_DISK_NAME\n```Replace the following:- ``: the name of the VM\n- ``: the name of the boot disk\n- Clone the boot disk and add the additional license:```\ngcloud compute disks create CLONED_BOOT_DISK_NAME \\\n --licenses=SQL_SERVER_LICENSE \\\n --source-disk=BOOT_DISK_NAME \\\n --source-disk-zone=BOOT_DISK_ZONE \\\n --zone=CLONED_BOOT_DISK_ZONE\n```Replace the following:- ``: the name you want to give the cloned book disk\n- ``: the SQL Server license you want to add to the boot disk\n- ``: the name of the source boot disk that you want to clone\n- ``: the zone of the source boot disk\n- ``: the zone in which you want to create the cloned boot disk\n- Verify that the new disk has the correct license:```\ngcloud compute disks describe CLONED_BOOT_DISK_NAME \\\n --zone=CLONED_BOOT_DISK_ZONE\n```Replace the following:- ``: the name of the cloned book disk\n- ``: the zone of the cloned boot disk\n- Attach the new disk as the boot disk for the VM instance:```\ngcloud compute instances attach-disk VM_NAME \\\n --disk=CLONED_BOOT_DISK_NAME\n --boot\n```Replace the following:- ``: the name of the VM instance to which you want to attach the cloned boot disk\n- ``: the name of the cloned book disk\n- Verify that the VM's boot disk is the new cloned disk with SQL Server licensing.```\ngcloud compute instances describe VM_NAME\n```Replace `` with the name of the VM.\n- Start the VM instance.```\ngcloud compute instances start VM_NAME\n```Replace `` with the name of the VM.\n- (Optional) When you are sure that you don't want to revert back to the earlier boot disk, you can delete the disk.```\ngcloud compute disks delete BOOT_DISK_NAME \\\n --zone=BOOT_DISK_ZONE\n```Replace the following:- ``: the name of the boot disk that you want to delete\n- ``: the zone of the boot disk\n## Install SQL Server on Linux\nFor guidance on installing, updating, and uninstalling SQL Server on Linux, see [Installation guidance for SQL Server on Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup?view=sql-server-ver16) .\n## What's next\n- [Learn about licenses](/compute/docs/licenses/about) \n- [View the SQL Server tutorials](/compute/docs/tutorials#sql-server) \n- [View the supported editions of SQL Server](/compute/docs/images/os-details#sql_server)", "guide": "Compute Engine"}
