Major TensorFlow release numbers end with '0' and all patch release numbers end with numbers greater than '0'. For example, TF 2.10.0 is a major release and TF 2.10.1 is a minor release.\nIn order to run the latest-supported framework version, check to see if there are any [patch releases](/tpu/docs/supported-patches) to the major release. If so, you can run the latest-supported patch release rather than the major release.\n| Framework | Major version | Model category   | Reference models       | Supported versions     |\n|:------------|:----------------|:-----------------------|:------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|\n| TensorFlow | 2.x    | Image classification | ResNet-2.x, MNIST-2.x, EfficientNet-2.x | See Supported TensorFlow versions. |\n| TensorFlow | 2.x    | Language modeling  | Transformer-2.x, BERT-2.x    | See Supported TensorFlow versions. |\n| TensorFlow | 2.x    | Object detection  | RetinaNet-2.x        | See Supported TensorFlow versions. |\n| TensorFlow | 2.x    | Image segmentation  | Mask-RCNN-2.x, ShapeMask-2.x    | See Supported TensorFlow versions. |\n| TensorFlow | 2.x    | Recommendation systems | DLRM-2.x, DCN-2.x, NCF-2.x    | See Supported TensorFlow versions. |\n| PyTorch  | 2.x    | Image classification | ResNet-PyTorch       | 1.13, 2.0       |\n| PyTorch  | 2.x    | Image generation  | Stable Diffusion,       | 1.13, 2.0       |\n| JAX   | latest   | Large Language Models | MaxText         | latest        |\n| JAX/FLAX | latest   | Image classification | ResNet50         | latest        ", "content": "|", "guide": "Cloud TPU"}
