{"title": "Virtual Private Cloud - Shared VPC", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc", "abstract": "# Virtual Private Cloud - Shared VPC\n# Shared VPC\nThis page provides an overview of Shared VPC in Google Cloud. Shared VPC allows an [organization](/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy) to connect resources from multiple projects to a common [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network](/vpc/docs/vpc) so that they can communicate with each other securely and efficiently by using internal IP addresses from that network.\nWhen you use Shared VPC, you designate a project as a and attach one or more other to it. The VPC networks in the host project are called . [Eligibleresources](#resources_that_can_be_attached_to_shared_vpc_networks_from_a_service_project) from service projects can use subnets in the Shared VPC network.\nShared VPC lets [organizationadministrators](/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#organizations) delegate administrative responsibilities, such as creating and managing instances, to [Service Project Admins](#iam_in_shared_vpc) while maintaining centralized control over network resources like subnets, routes, and firewalls. This model allows organizations to do the following:\n- Implement a security best practice of least privilege for network administration, auditing, and access control. Shared VPC Admins can delegate network administration tasks to Network and Security Admins in the Shared VPC network without allowing Service Project Admins to make network-impacting changes. Service Project Admins are only given the ability to create and manage instances that make use of the Shared VPC network. Refer to the [administrators and IAM](#iam_in_shared_vpc) section for more details.\n- Apply and enforce consistent access control policies at the network level for multiple service projects in the organization while delegating administrative responsibilities. For example, Service Project Admins can be Compute Instance Admins in their project, creating and deleting instances that use approved subnets in the Shared VPC host project.\n- Use service projects to separate budgeting or internal cost centers. Refer to the [billing](#billing) section for more details.\n**Note:** Shared VPC is also referred to as \"XPN\" in the API.\n", "content": "## Concepts\n### Organizations, folders, and projects\nShared VPC connects projects within the same [organization](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization) . Linked projects can be in the same or different [folders](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders) , but if they are in different folders the admin must have [Shared VPC Admin](#iam_in_shared_vpc) rights to both folders. Refer to the Google Cloud [resourcehierarchy](/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy) for more information about organizations, folders, and projects.\nParticipating host and service projects cannot belong to different organizations. The only exception is during a migration of your projects from one organization to another. During the migration, service projects can be in a different organization than the host project temporarily. For more information about migrating projects, see [Migratingprojects](/resource-manager/docs/project-migration#shared_vpc) .\nA project that participates in Shared VPC is either a or a :\n- A host project contains one or more [Shared VPCnetworks](#shared_vpc_networks) . A [Shared VPC Admin](#iam_in_shared_vpc) must first [enable](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#enable-shared-vpc-host) a project as a host project. After that, a Shared VPC Admin can attach one or more service projects to it.\n- A service project is any project that has been [attached](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#create-shared) to a host project by a Shared VPC Admin. This attachment allows it to participate in Shared VPC. It's a common practice to have multiple service projects operated and administered by different departments or teams in your organization.\n- A project cannot be both a host project and a service project simultaneously. Thus, a service project cannot be a host project to further service projects.\n- You can create and use multiple host projects; however, each service project can only be attached to a single host project. For an illustration, see the [multiple host projects example](#example_multiple_host_projects) .\n- You can create networks, subnets, secondary address ranges, firewall rules, and other network resources in the host project. The host project can then share selected subnets, including secondary ranges, with the service projects. Services running in a service project can use Shared VPC to communicate with resources running in the other service projects.\nFor clarity, a project that does not participate in Shared VPC is called a . This emphasizes that it is neither a host project nor a service project.\nA is an unshared VPC network that exists in either a standalone project or a service project.\n### Networks\nA **Shared VPC network** is a [VPC network](/vpc/docs/vpc) defined in a host project and made available as a centrally shared network for [eligibleresources](#resources_that_can_be_attached_to_shared_vpc_networks_from_a_service_project) in service projects. Shared VPC networks can be either [auto or custommode](/vpc/docs/vpc#subnet-ranges) , but [legacynetworks](/compute/docs/vpc/legacy) are not supported.\nWhen a host project is enabled, you have two options for sharing networks:\n- You can share all host project subnets. If you select this option, then any new subnets created in the host project, including subnets in new networks, will also be shared.\n- You can specify individual subnets to share. If you share subnets individually, then only those subnets are shared unless you manually change the list.\nHost and service projects are connected by attachments **at the project level** . Subnets of the Shared VPC networks in the host project are accessible by Service Project Admins as described in the next section, [administrators andIAM](#iam_in_shared_vpc) .\n### Organization policy constraints\nOrganization policies and IAM permissions [worktogether](/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview#differences_from_iam) to provide different levels of access control. Organization policies enable you to set controls at the organization, folder, or project level.\nIf you are an [organization policyadministrator](/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/creating-managing-policies) , you can specify the following Shared VPC constraints in an organization policy:\n- You can limit the set of host projects to which a non-host project or non-host projects in a folder or organization can be attached. The constraint applies when a Shared VPC Admin attaches a service project with a host project. The constraint doesn't affect [existing attachments](/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview#violations) . Existing attachments remain intact even if a policy denies new ones. For more information, see the [constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcHostProject](/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) constraint.\n- You can specify the Shared VPC subnets that a service project can access at the project, folder, or organization level. The constraint applies when you create new resources in the specified subnets and doesn't affect [existing resources](/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview#violations) . Existing resources continue to operate normally in their subnets even if a policy prevents new resources from being added. For more information, see the [constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcSubnetworks](/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) constraint.## Administrators and IAM\nShared VPC makes use of [Identity and Access Management(IAM)](/iam/docs/overview) roles for delegated administration. The following roles can be granted to [IAMprincipals](/iam/docs/overview#concepts_related_identity) , such as users, Google groups, Google domains, or Google Cloud service accounts. If you need to contact any of these admins, you can look them up in your organization's or project's [IAM policy](/iam/docs/overview#iam_policy) . If you don't have the required permissions, you must contact a network or project administrator in your organization.\n### Required administrative roles\n| Administrator (IAM role)                                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Organization Admin (resourcemanager.organizationAdmin) \u2022 IAM principal in the organization                      | Organization Admins have the resourcemanager.organizationAdmin role for your organization. They nominate Shared VPC Admins by granting them appropriate project creation and deletion roles, and the Shared VPC Admin role for the organization. These admins can define organization-level policies, but specific folder and project actions require additional folder and project roles.                                                                                                                       |\n| Shared VPC Admin (compute.xpnAdmin and resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin) \u2022 IAM principal in the organization, or \u2022 IAM principal in a folder         | Shared VPC Admins have the Compute Shared VPC Admin (compute.xpnAdmin) and Project IAM Admin (resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin) roles for the organization or one or more folders. They perform various tasks necessary to set up Shared VPC, such as enabling host projects, attaching service projects to host projects, and delegating access to some or all of the subnets in Shared VPC networks to Service Project Admins. A Shared VPC Admin for a given host project is typically its project owner as well. A user assigned the Compute Shared VPC Admin role for the organization has that role for all folders in the organization. A user assigned the role for a folder has that role for the given folder and any folders nested underneath it. A Shared VPC Admin can link projects in two different folders only if the admin has the role for both folders. |\n| Service Project Admin (compute.networkUser) \u2022 IAM principal in the organization, or \u2022 IAM principal in a host project, or \u2022 IAM principal in some subnets in the host project | A Shared VPC Admin defines a Service Project Admin by granting an IAM principal the Network User (compute.networkUser) role to either the whole host project or select subnets of its Shared VPC networks. Service Project Admins also maintain ownership and control over resources defined in the service projects, so they should have the Instance Admin (compute.instanceAdmin) role to the corresponding service projects. They may have additional IAM roles to the service projects, such as project owner.                                                                                        |\n### Service Project Admins\nWhen defining each Service Project Admin, a Shared VPC Admin can grant permission to use the whole host project or just some subnets:\n- **Project-level permissions** : A Service Project Admin can be defined to have [permission to use allsubnets](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#networkuseratproject) in the host project if the Shared VPC Admin grants the role of `compute.networkUser` for the whole host project to the Service Project Admin. The result is that the Service Project Admin has permission to use all subnets in all VPC networks of the host project, including subnets and VPC networks added to the host project in the future.\n- **Subnet-level permissions** : Alternatively, a Service Project Admin can be granted a more restrictive set of [permissions to use only somesubnets](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#networkuseratsubnet) if the Shared VPC Admin grants the role of `compute.networkUser` for those selected subnets to the Service Project Admin. A Service Project Admin who only has subnet-level permissions is restricted to using only those subnets. After new Shared VPC networks or new subnets are added to the host project, a Shared VPC Admin should review the permission bindings for the `compute.networkUser` role to ensure that the subnet-level permissions for all Service Project Admins match the intended configuration.\n### Network and Security Admins\nShared VPC Admins have full control over the resources in the host project, including administration of the Shared VPC network. They can optionally delegate certain network administrative tasks to other IAM principals:\n| Administrator                    | Purpose                                                             |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Network Admin \u2022 IAM principal in the host project, or \u2022 IAM principal in the organization | Shared VPC Admin defines a Network Admin by granting an IAM principal the Network Admin (compute.networkAdmin) role to the host project. Network Admins have full control over all network resources except for firewall rules and SSL certificates. |\n| Security Admin \u2022 IAM principal in the host project, or \u2022 IAM principal in the organization | A Shared VPC Admin can define a Security Admin by granting an IAM principal the Security Admin (compute.securityAdmin) role to the host project. Security Admins manage firewall rules and SSL certificates.           |\n## Specifications\n### Quotas and limits\nShared VPC host projects are subject to standard [per-projectVPC quotas](/vpc/docs/quota#per_project) . Shared VPC networks are subject to the [per-network limits](/vpc/docs/quota#per_network) and [per-instance limits](/vpc/docs/quota#per_instance) for VPC networks. Additionally, the relationships between host and service projects are governed by [limits specific to Shared VPC](/vpc/docs/quota#shared-vpc) .\n### Billing\nBilling for resources that participate in a Shared VPC network is attributed to the service project where the resource is located, even though the resource uses the Shared VPC network in the host project.\n- The [rates and rules](/compute/pricing) used to calculate billing amounts for resources in service projects using a Shared VPC network is the same as if the resources were located in the host project itself.\n- Billing for outbound traffic generated by a resource is attributed to the project where the resource is defined:- Outbound traffic from an instance is attributed to the project containing the instance. For example, if an instance is created in a service project but uses a Shared VPC network, any billing for outbound traffic that it generates is attributed to its service project. In this way, you can use Shared VPC to organize resources into cost centers for your organization.\n- Costs associated with a [load balancer](/vpc/network-pricing#lb) are charged to the project containing the load balancer components. For more details about load balancing and Shared VPC, see [the load balancingsection](#shared_vpc_with_load_balancing) .\n- Outbound traffic to VPNs is attributed to the project containing the VPN Gateway resource. For example, if a VPN Gateway is created in the Shared VPC network, it is contained in the host project. Outbound traffic through the VPN Gateway \u2014 regardless of which service project initiates the outbound data transfer \u2014 is attributed to the host project.\n- Costs for traffic from a resource in a Shared VPC service project that transfers out through a VLAN attachment are attributed to the project that owns the VLAN attachment. For more information, see [Cloud Interconnectpricing](/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/pricing) .\n## Resources\n[](None)\n### Eligible resources\nYou can use most Google Cloud products and features in Shared VPC service projects.\nThe following limitations apply to resources that are eligible for participation in a Shared VPC scenario:\n- For example, instance admins can create instances in the service project that use a VPC network in that project. Networks defined in service projects are not shared.\n- When a Shared VPC Admin [attaches an existing project to a hostproject](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#create-shared) , that project becomes a service project, but its existing resources do not automatically use shared network resources. To use a Shared VPC network, a Service Project Admin has to create an eligible resource and configure it to use a subnet of a Shared VPC network. For example, an existing instance in a service project cannot be reconfigured to use a Shared VPC network, but a new instance can be created to use available subnets in a Shared VPC network. This limitation applies to private zones.\n### IP addresses\nWhen you create an instance in a service project, you can configure it as a single-stack (IPv4 only) instance or dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) instance, depending on the host project's subnet configuration. For more information, see [Create an instance](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#creating_an_instance_in_a_shared_subnet) .\nInstances in service projects attached to a host project that uses the same Shared VPC network can communicate internally with one another by using either their internal IPv4 addresses or their internal or external IPv6 addresses, subject to applicable [firewall rules](/vpc/docs/firewalls) .\nService Project Admins can assign any of the following IP address types to resources in a service project:\n- **Ephemeral IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:** An ephemeral IP address can be automatically assigned to an instance in a service project. For example, when Service Project Admins [createinstances](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#creating_an_instance_in_a_shared_subnet) , they select the Shared VPC network and an [available sharedsubnet](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#discovering_subnets_that_can_be_used) . The instance's primary internal IPv4 address comes from the range of available IP addresses in the selected shared subnet's primary IPv4 address range. If they configure the instance as a dual-stack instance, the instance's IPv6 address comes from the range of available IP addresses in the selected shared subnet's IPv6 subnet range.Ephemeral IPv4 addresses can also be automatically assigned to internal load balancers. For more information, see [create aninternal passthrough Network Load Balancer](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#creating_an_internal_load_balancer_forwarding_rule) or [create an internal Application Load Balancer](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#creating_an_internal_HTTPS_load_balancer) .\n- **Static internal IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:** A static internal IPv4 or IPv6 address can be reserved in a service project. The internal IPv4 or IPv6 address must be created in the same service project as the resource that uses it, even though the value of the IP address comes from the available IP addresses of the selected shared subnet in a Shared VPC network. For more information, see [Reserve static internal IP4 and IPv6 addresses](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#reserve_internal_ip) on the \"Provision Shared VPC\" page.\n- **Static external IPv4 addresses:** External IPv4 address objects defined in the host project can be used by resources in that host project or any attached service project. Service projects can also use their own external IPv4 address objects. For example, an instance in a service project can use a regional external IPv4 address defined in either its service project or in the host project.\n- **Static external IPv6 addresses:** A Service Project Admin can also choose to reserve a static external IPv6 address. The external IPv6 address must be created in the same service project as the resource that uses it, even though the value of the IP address comes from the available IPv6 addresses of the selected shared subnet in a Shared VPC network. For more information, see [Reserve a static external IPv6 address](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#reserve_external_ipv6) on the page.\n### Internal DNS\nVMs in the same service project can reach each other using the internal DNS names that Google Cloud creates automatically. These DNS names use the project ID of the where the VMs are created, even though the names point to internal IP addresses in the host project. For a complete explanation, see [Internal DNS names and Shared VPC](/compute/docs/internal-dns#shared-vpc) in the documentation.\n### Cloud DNS private zones\nYou can use Cloud DNS private zones in a Shared VPC network. You can create your private zone in the host project and authorize access to the zone for the Shared VPC network or set up the zone in a service project using [cross-project binding](/dns/docs/zones/cross-project-binding) .\n### Load balancing\nShared VPC can be used in conjunction with [Cloud Load Balancing](/load-balancing/docs/load-balancing-overview) . In most cases, you create the backend instances in a service project. In that case, all load balancer components are created in that project. While it's possible to create backend instances in the host project, such a setup is not well suited for typical Shared VPC deployments since it does not separate network administration and service development responsibilities.\nUse the links in the following table to learn more about supported Shared VPC architectures for each type of load balancer.\n| Load balancer type       | Links     |\n|:-------------------------------------------|:-------------------------|\n| External Application Load Balancer   | Shared VPC architecture |\n| Internal Application Load Balancer   | Shared VPC architecture |\n| External proxy Network Load Balancer  | Shared VPC architecture |\n| Internal proxy Network Load Balancer  | Shared VPC architecture |\n| Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer | Shared VPC architecture |\n| External passthrough Network Load Balancer | Shared VPC architecture |\n## Examples and use cases\n### Basic concepts\nFigure 1 illustrates a simple Shared VPC scenario:- A Shared VPC Admin for the organization has created a host project and attached two service projects to it:- Service Project Admins in `Service project A` can be configured to access all or some of the subnets in the Shared VPC network. A Service Project Admin with at least subnet-level permissions to the `10.0.1.0/24 subnet` has created `Instance A` in a zone of the `us-west1` region. This instance receives its internal IP address, `10.0.1.3` , from the `10.0.1.0/24` CIDR block.\n- Service Project Admins in `Service project B` can be configured to access all or some of the subnets in the Shared VPC network. A Service Project Admin with at least subnet-level permissions to the `10.15.2.0/24 subnet` has created `Instance B` in a zone of the `us-east1` region. This instance receives its internal IP address, `10.15.2.4` , from the `10.15.2.0/24` CIDR block.\n- The does not participate in the Shared VPC at all; it is neither a host nor a service project. Standalone instances are created by IAM principals who have at least the `compute.InstanceAdmin` role for the project.\n### Multiple host projects\nFigure 2 demonstrates how Shared VPC can be used to build separate testing and production environments. For this case, an organization has decided to use two separate host projects, a and a .- A Shared VPC Admin for the organization has created two host projects and attached two service projects to them as follows:- The `Apps testing` and `Mobile testing` service projects are attached to the `Test environment` host project. Service Project Admins in each project can be configured to access all or some of the subnets in the `Testing network` .\n- The `Apps production` and `Mobile production` service projects are attached to the `Production environment` host project. Service Project Admins in each project can be configured to access all or some of the subnets in the `Production network` .\n- Both host projects have one Shared VPC network with subnets configured to use the same CIDR ranges. In both the `Testing network` and `Production network` , the two subnets are:- `10.0.1.0/24 subnet` in the `us-west1` region\n- `10.15.2.0/24 subnet` in the `us-east1` region\n- Consider `Instance AT` in the `Apps testing` service project and `Instance AP` in the `Apps production` service project:- Service Project Admins can create instances like them provided they have at least subnet-level permissions to the `10.0.1.0/24 subnet` .\n- Notice that both instances use the IP address `10.0.1.3` . This is acceptable because each instance exists in a service project attached to a unique host project containing its own Shared VPC network. Both the testing and production networks have been purposefully configured in the same way.\n- Instances using the `10.0.1.0/24 subnet` must be located in a zone in the same region as the subnet, even though the subnet and instances are defined in separate projects. Because the `10.0.1.0/24 subnet` is located in the `us-west1` region, Service Project Admins who create instances using that subnet must choose a zone in the same region, such as `us-west1-a` .\n### Hybrid cloud scenario\nFigure 3 demonstrates how Shared VPC can be used in a hybrid environment.\nFor this example, an organization has a created a single host project with a single Shared VPC network. The Shared VPC network is connected by using [Cloud VPN](/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/concepts/overview) to an on-premises network. Some services and applications are hosted in Google Cloud while others are kept on-premises:\n- A Shared VPC Admin enabled the host project and connected three service projects to it: `Service project A` , `Service project B` , and `Service project C` .- Separate teams can manage each of the service projects. IAM permissions have been configured such that a Service Project Admin for one project has no permissions to the other service projects.\n- The Shared VPC Admin has granted subnet-level or project-level permissions to the necessary Service Project Admins so they can [createinstances](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#creating_an_instance_in_a_shared_subnet) that use the Shared VPC network:- A Service Project Admin for `Service project A` who has subnet-level permissions to the `10.0.1.0/24 subnet` can create `Instance A` in it. The Service Project Admin has to choose a zone in the `us-west1` region for the instance, because that is the region that contains the `10.0.1.0/24 subnet` . `Instance A` receives its IP address, `10.0.1.3` , from the range of free IP addresses in the `10.0.1.0/24 subnet` .\n- A Service Project Admin for `Service project B` who has subnet-level permissions to the `10.15.2.0/24 subnet` can create `Instance B` in it. The Service Project Admin has to choose a zone in the `us-east1` region for the instance, because that is the region that contains the `10.15.2.0/24 subnet` . `Instance B` receives its IP address, `10.15.2.4` , from the range of free IP addresses in `10.15.2.0/24 subnet` .\n- A Service Project Admin for `Service project C` who has project-level permissions to the whole host project can create instances in any of the subnets in any of the VPC networks in the host project. For example, the Service Project Admin can create `Instance C` in the `10.7.1.0/24 subnet` , choosing a zone in the `us-east1` region to match the region for the subnet. `Instance C` receives its IP address, `10.7.1.50` , from the range of free IP addresses in the `10.7.1.0/24 Subnet` .\n- Each service project is billed separately.\n- The Service Project Admins in each project are responsible for [creatingand managing resources](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#create-resources) .\n- A Shared VPC Admin has delegated network administration tasks to other IAM principals who are [Network and Security Admins](#net_and_security_admins) for the Shared VPC network.- A Network Admin has created a Cloud VPN gateway and configured a VPN tunnel through the internet to an on-premises gateway. The Cloud VPN exchanges and receives routes with its on-premises counterpart because a corresponding Cloud Router in the same `us-east1` region [has beenconfigured](/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/how-to/creating-vpn-dynamic-routes) .\n- If the [dynamicrouting mode](/vpc/docs/vpc#routing_for_hybrid_networks) of the VPC is global, the Cloud Router applies the learned routes to the on-premises network in all subnets in the VPC network, and it shares routes to all of the VPC subnets with its on-premises counterpart.\n- Security Admins create and manage firewall rules in the Shared VPC network to control traffic among instances in Google Cloud and the on-premises network.\n- Subject to applicable firewall rules, instances in the service projects can be configured to communicate with internal services, such as database or directory servers located on-premises.\n### Two-tier web service\nFigure 4 demonstrates how Shared VPC can be employed to delegate administrative responsibilities and maintain the principle of least privilege. For this case, an organization has a web service that is separated into two tiers, and different teams manage each tier. Tier 1 represents the externally facing component, behind an [HTTP(S) loadbalancer](/load-balancing/docs/https) . Tier 2 represents an internal service upon which Tier 1 relies, and it is balanced using an [internal TCP/UDPload balancer](/load-balancing/docs/internal) .\nShared VPC lets you map each tier of the web service to different projects so that they can be managed by different teams while sharing a common VPC network:\n- Resources, such as instances and load balancer components, for each tier are placed in individual service projects managed by different teams.\n- Each tier service project has been attached to the host project by a Shared VPC Admin. The Shared VPC Admin also enabled the host project.- Separate teams can manage each tier of the web service by virtue of being a Service Project Admin in the appropriate service project.\n- Each service project is billed separately.\n- The Service Project Admins in each project are responsible for [creatingand managing resources](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#create-resources) .\n- Network access control is delineated as follows:- IAM principals who only work on Tier 1 are Service Project Admins for the `Tier 1 service project` and are granted subnet-level permissions for only the `10.0.1.0/24 subnet` . In this example, one such Service Project Admin has created three `Tier 1 instances` in that subnet.\n- IAM principals who only work on Tier 2 are Service Project Admins for the `Tier 2 service project` and are granted subnet-level permissions for just the `10.0.2.0/24 subnet` . In this example, another Service Project Admin has created three `Tier 2 instances` in that subnet along with an internal load balancer whose forwarding rule uses an IP address from the range available in that subnet.\n- IAM principals who oversee the whole web service are Service Project Admins in both service projects, and they have project-level permissions to the host project so they can use any subnet defined in it.\n- Optionally, a Shared VPC Admin can delegate network administration tasks to [Network and Security Admins](#net_and_security_admins) .\n## What's next\n- To set up Shared VPC, see [Provisioning Shared VPC](/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc) .\n- To set up Kubernetes Engine clusters with Shared VPC, see [Setting up clusters with Shared VPC](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-shared-vpc) .\n- To delete a Shared VPC setup, see [Deprovisioning Shared VPC](/vpc/docs/deprovisioning-shared-vpc) .", "guide": "Virtual Private Cloud"}
