Those metrics include the user workload VMs and the VMs used as user cluster nodes.\nFor information on the VM-level metrics dashboard and details about how the dashboard presents the metrics visually, see [Monitor VM metrics](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/application/ao-user/vms/monitor/monitor-metrics) .\nUse the `namespace` label to filter the VMs in different namespaces.\n", "content": "## Metrics list\n| Name and Description                                                          | Name and Description.1                                                         | Type             | Scrape interval           | Labels                                                        |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| compute_instance_cpu_usage                                                        | compute_instance_cpu_usage                                                        | compute_instance_cpu_usage        | compute_instance_cpu_usage        | compute_instance_cpu_usage                                                   |\n| The amount of time each vCPU spends in different states.                                                 | The amount of time each vCPU spends in different states.                                                 | Counter             | 10\u00a0s             | name: The name of the VM. namespace: The project associated with the VM. state: The state of the vCPU, such as running, stopped, or paused. id: The numerical index of the vCPU, which ranges from 0 to the maximum vCPU count -
