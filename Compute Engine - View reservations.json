{"title": "Compute Engine - View reservations", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances", "abstract": "# Compute Engine - View reservations\nThis document explains how to view reservations.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\n- Review the [requirements](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-overview#requirements) and [restrictions](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-overview#restrictions) for reservations.\n- If you haven't already, set up authentication. [Authentication](/compute/docs/authentication) is the process by which your identity is verified for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to Compute Engine as follows.Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:\nWhen you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and   APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:```\ngcloud init\n``` **Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI  previously, make sure you have the latest version by running`gcloud components  update`.\n- [ Set a default region and zone](/compute/docs/gcloud-compute#set_default_zone_and_region_in_your_local_client) .\nTo use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:\n- ```\ngcloud init\n```\n### Required roles\nTo get the permissions that you need to view reservations,   ask your administrator to grant you the [Compute Admin ](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#compute.admin) ( `roles/compute.admin` ) IAM role on the project.    For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nThis predefined role contains     the permissions required to view reservations. To see the exact permissions that are   required, expand the **Required permissions** section:\nYou might also be able to get   these permissions  with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or  other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\n## View your reservations\nYou can only view the reservations that were created in your current project.\nOnly the owner project can view a shared reservation. If you want to see the projects a shared reservation is shared with, [view the details of the reservation](#describe-reservations) .\n### View a list of your reservations\nTo view a list of your reservations, use the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI, or REST.\nIn the Google Cloud console, go to the **Reservations** page.\n [Go to Reservations](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/reservations) \nThe **Reservations** page appears.\nIn the table, each row describes a reservation and each column describes a property. For example, the **Used machines** column describes the utilization and total capacity of each reservation: a value of `25 (50)` represents a reservation for 50 VMs where 25 of these VMs have been consumed.\nOptional: To modify which reservations and properties are displayed, use filter_list **Filter** and view_column **Column display options** respectively.\nTo view a list of your reservations, use the [gcloud compute reservations list command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/reservations/list) .\n```\ngcloud compute reservations list \\\n --project=PROJECT_ID\n```\nReplace `` with the ID of the project where your reservations are located.\nThe output should be similar to the following example:\n```\nNAME: r-01\nIN_USE_COUNT: 0\nCOUNT: 5\nZONE: us-central1-a\nSHARE_TYPE: LOCAL\nNAME: r-02\nIN_USE_COUNT: 3\nCOUNT: 10\nZONE: us-central1-f\nSHARE_TYPE: LOCAL\n```\nOptionally, to narrow down a list of reservations using a [filter expression](/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/filters#Filter-Expressions) , specify the `--filter` flag.\n```\ngcloud compute reservations list \\\n --filter=\"FILTER_EXPRESSION\" \\\n --project=PROJECT_ID\n```\nReplace the following:- `` : a filter expression.\n- `` : the ID of the project where your reservations are located.\nFor example, to only view reservations with a name that starts with `prefix` and are located in zone `us-central1-a` , run the following command:\n```\ngcloud compute reservations list \\\n --filter=\"name~prefix AND zone=us-central1-a\" \\\n --project=example-project\n```\nTo view a list of your reservations, make a `GET` request to the [reservations.list method](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/reservations/list) .\n```\nGET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/zones/ZONE/reservations\n```\nReplace the following:- `` : the ID of the project where your reservations are located.\n- `` : the zone where your reservations are located.\nThe output is similar to the following example:\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"4100668622331754141\",\n \"creationTimestamp\": \"2019-09-27T08:21:14.707-07:00\",\n \"selfLink\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a/reservations/reservation-05\",\n \"zone\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a\",\n \"name\": \"reservation-05\",\n \"specificReservation\": {\n \"instanceProperties\": {\n  \"machineType\": \"n1-standard-2\",\n  \"minCpuPlatform\": \"Any CPU Platform\",\n },\n \"count\": \"100\",\n \"inUseCount\": \"0\"\n },\n \"specificReservationRequired\": false,\n \"status\": \"READY\",\n \"kind\": \"compute#reservation\"\n},\n{\n \"id\": \"2533514314332214789\",\n \"creationTimestamp\": \"2019-09-27T08:21:14.707-07:00\",\n \"selfLink\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a/reservations/reservation-04\",\n \"zone\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a\",\n \"name\": \"reservation-04\",\n \"specificReservation\": {\n \"instanceProperties\": {\n  \"machineType\": \"n1-standard-2\",\n  \"guestAccelerators\": [  {\n   \"acceleratorType\": \"nvidia-tesla-k80\",\n   \"acceleratorCount\": 1\n  }\n  ],\n  \"minCpuPlatform\": \"Any CPU Platform\",\n  \"localSsds\": [  {\n   \"diskSizeGb\": \"375\",\n   \"interface\": \"SCSI\"\n  }\n  ]\n },\n \"count\": \"50\",\n \"inUseCount\": \"25\"\n },\n \"specificReservationRequired\": false,\n \"status\": \"READY\",\n \"kind\": \"compute#reservation\"\n}\n```\nOptionally, to narrow down a list of reservations using a [filter expression](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/reservations/list#body.QUERY_PARAMETERS.filter) , make the following `GET` request:\n```\nGET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/zones/ZONE/reservations?filter=FILTER_EXPRESSION\n```\nReplace the following:- `` : the ID of the project where your reservations are located.\n- `` : the zone where your reservations are located.\n- `` : a filter expression.\nFor example, to only view reservations with a name that starts with `prefix` and are located in zone `us-central1-a` , make the following `GET` request using URL-encoded values:\n```\nGET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/example-project/zones/us-central1-a/reservations?filter=name%7Eprefix%20AND%20zone=us-central1-a\n```\n### View details of a reservation\nTo view the details of a reservation, use the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI, or REST.\nTo view the details of a reservation, do the following:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Reservations** page. [Go to Reservations](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/reservations) The **Reservations** page appears.\n- In the **Name** column, click the name of the reservation you want to describe.The details page for the reservation appears. To determine the utilization of a reservation, see the **Total Machines Reserved** and **Machines used** fields.\nTo view the details of a reservation, use the [gcloud compute reservations describe command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/reservations/describe) .\n **Important:** If you want to view the `deleteAtTime` field in a reservation, use the [gcloud beta compute reservations describe command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/reservations/describe) instead.\n```\ngcloud compute reservations describe RESERVATION_NAME \\\n --project=PROJECT_ID \\\n --zone=ZONE\n```\nReplace the following:- `` : the name of an existing reservation.\n- `` : the ID of the project where the reservation is located.\n- `` : the zone where the reservation is located.\nThe output should be similar to the following example:\n```\nkind: compute#reservation\nname: reservation-04\nselfLink: https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a/reservations/reservation-04\nspecificReservation:\n count: '50'\n inUseCount: '25'\n instanceProperties:\n guestAccelerators:\n - acceleratorCount: 1\n  acceleratorType: nvidia-tesla-k80\n localSsds:\n - diskSizeGb: '375'\n  interface: SCSI\n machineType: n1-standard-2\n minCpuPlatform: Any CPU Platform\nspecificReservationRequired: false\nstatus: READY\nzone: https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a\n```\nTo determine the utilization of a reservation, see the `count` and `inUseCount` fields.
