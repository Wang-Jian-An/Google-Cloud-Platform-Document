You can use the sample Kubernetes cluster in most GKE tutorials.\n", "content": "## Clean up to avoid billing charges\nIf you created a new project to learn about GKE and you no longer need the project, [delete the project](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) .\nIf you used an existing GKE project, delete the resources you created to avoid incurring charges to your account:\n- Go to the GKE **Clusters** page. [Go to Clusters](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview) \n- Select the row containing **hello-world-cluster** , and click .\n- In the **Delete hello-world-cluster** window, do the following:- In the **hello-world-cluster** field, enter `hello-world-cluster` .\n- Click **Delete** .\nIf you receive an error message about the cluster being repaired, you can wait for the process to complete, and then delete the cluster. This operation might take some time to complete.\n- If you created a logs sink and bucket when following instructions in other tutorials:- Go to the Cloud Logging **Logs storage** page. [Go to Logs storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/storage) \n- Select **hello-world-cluster-bucket** and click **Delete** .\n- Go to the Logging **Log router** page. [Go to Log router](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/router) \n- Select **hello-world-cluster-sink** and click **Delete** .\n## What's next\n- View [code samples](/docs/samples) demonstrating the usage of Google Cloud products.\n- Discover [best practices and reference architectures](/architecture/application-development) for application development \"Architecture guides for application development\"\n- [Plan, architect, deploy, and operate](/kubernetes-engine/docs/best-practices/scalability) large workloads on GKE clusters while scaling workloads within service-level objectives (SLOs).", "guide": "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)"}
