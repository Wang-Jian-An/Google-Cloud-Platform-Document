You can also read more [about cluster configuration choices](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/types-of-clusters) and about [cluster architecture](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture) .\n", "content": "## Before you begin\nBefore you start, make sure you have performed the following tasks:\n- Enable    the Google Kubernetes Engine API.\n- [    Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API   ](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=container.googleapis.com) \n- If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task, [install](/sdk/docs/install) and then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) the  gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest  version by running`gcloud components update`. **Note:** For existing gcloud CLI  installations, make sure to set the`compute/region`and`compute/zone` [properties](/sdk/docs/properties#setting_properties) . By setting default locations,  you can avoid errors in gcloud CLI like the following:`One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location`.\n- Ensure you have the correct permission to create clusters. At minimum, you should be a [Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#kubernetes-engine-roles) .\n- Be sure you understand the [limitations of alpha clusters](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/alpha-clusters#limitations) .## Create an alpha cluster\nYou can create an alpha cluster by using the gcloud CLI or the Google Cloud console.\nRun the following command:\n```\ngcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \\\u00a0 \u00a0 --enable-kubernetes-alpha \\\u00a0 \u00a0 --no-enable-autorepair \\\u00a0 \u00a0 --no-enable-autoupgrade \\\u00a0 \u00a0 --region COMPUTE_REGION\n```\nReplace the following:- ``: the name you choose for the cluster.\n- ``: the [Compute Engine region](/compute/docs/regions-zones#available) for the cluster. For zonal clusters, use the`--zone` ``option.\n- `--cluster-version` `` : (optional) specifies the GKE [version](/kubernetes-engine/versioning-and-upgrades) to run in the cluster. If omitted, the cluster runs the current default version documented in [Versioning and upgrades](/kubernetes-engine/versioning-and-upgrades) . **Note:** It's not possible to create an alpha cluster enrolled in a release channel, because auto-upgrade can't be disabled when using release channels, but alpha clusters can't be upgraded.\nYou can optionally use the `--service-account=` `` `@` `` `.iam.gserviceaccount.com` flag to specify a different IAM service account that nodes in your cluster's first node pool uses instead of the Compute Engine default service account. This flag is optional, but we strongly recommend that you [create and use a minimally-privileged service account](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#use_least_privilege_sa) so that your nodes don't have more privileges that they require.\nYou are prompted to acknowledge a warning that the alpha cluster is not upgraded and is deleted after 30 days:\n```\nThis will create a cluster with all Kubernetes Alpha features enabled.\n- This cluster will not be covered by the GKE SLA and should\n not be used for production workloads.\n- You will not be able to upgrade the master or nodes.\n- The cluster will be deleted after 30 days.\n```- Go to the **Google Kubernetes Engine** page in the Google Cloud console. [Go to Google Kubernetes Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list) \n- Click **Create** .\n- In the **Cluster basics** section, complete the following:- Enter the **Name** for your cluster.\n- For the **Location type** , select **Zonal** , and then select the [zone](/compute/docs/regions-zones#available) for your cluster.\n- If you are creating a multi-zonal cluster, select the **Specify default node locations** checkbox, and then choose additional zones in which you'd like the node pools to run.\n- From the **Release channel** drop-down list, select **No channel** . **Note:** It's not possible to create an alpha cluster enrolled in a release channel, because auto-upgrade cannot be disabled when using release channels, but alpha clusters cannot be upgraded.\n- Optional: Specify a control plane version from the **Version** drop-down list.\n- Optional (available with [GKE Enterprise](/anthos/docs/concepts/gke-editions) ): If you want to register your new cluster to a [fleet](/anthos/fleet-management/docs) , go to the **Fleet registration** section, and follow the Google Cloud console instructions for [Create and register a new cluster](/anthos/fleet-management/docs/register/gke#console) to complete your cluster registration.\n- From the navigation pane, under **Node Pools** , click **default-pool** .\n- In the **Node pool details** section, complete the following:- Enter a **Name** for the default [Node pool](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-pools) .\n- Optional: Choose the **Node version** .\n- Enter the **Number of nodes** to create in the cluster. You must have available [resource quota](/compute/quotas) for the nodes and their resources (such as firewall routes).\n- Optional: You can choose to disable node auto-upgrades, however we recommend that you review the [considerations before disabling nodeauto-upgrades](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-upgrades#considerations) before choosing this option.\n- Clear **Enable auto-upgrade** and **Enable auto-repair** .\n- From the navigation pane, under **Node Pools** , click **Nodes** .\n- From the **Image type** drop-down list, select the [node image](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-images) .\n- Choose the default [Machine configuration](/compute/docs/machine-types) to use for the instances. Each machine type is billed differently. The default machine type is `e2-medium` . For machine type pricing information, refer to the [machine type price sheet](/compute/pricing#standard_machine_types) .\n- From the **Boot disk type** drop-down list, select the [disk type](/compute/docs/disks) .\n- Enter the **Boot disk size** .\n- Optional: From the navigation pane, under **Node Pools** , click **Security** .\n- Optional: From the **Service account** drop-down list, select an Identity and Access Management (IAM) service account for your applications to use when calling Google Cloud APIs. We recommend that you [use a minimally privileged service account](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#use_least_privilege_sa) instead of using the default service account, so that your nodes don't have more privileges that they require.\n- From the navigation pane, under **Cluster** , click **Features** .\n- Click **Enable Kubernetes alpha features in this cluster** .\n- Read and acknowledge the warning by selecting **I understand the consequences** .\n- Click **Create** .\n### Interact with a cluster using kubectl\nAfter you create a cluster, you need to [configure kubectl](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#generate_kubeconfig_entry) before you can interact with the cluster from the command line.\n## Check when an alpha cluster expires\nTo check when alpha clusters expire, run the following command:\n```\ngcloud container clusters list\n```\n## What's next\n- Learn more about the [types of clusters](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/types-of-clusters) you can create.\n- [Learn about managing your clusters](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/managing-clusters) .\n- [Learn how to delete clusters](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/deleting-a-cluster) .", "guide": "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)"}
