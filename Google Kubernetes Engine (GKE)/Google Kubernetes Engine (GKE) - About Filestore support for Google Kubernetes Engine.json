This lets you initiate Pods on any available GKE node, giving you greater efficiency of your GKE clusters.\n- As a type of [file storage](/filestore/docs/overview) , Filestore supports multiple concurrent application instances accessing the same file system, simultaneously.\nFor more information, see [Deploy a stateful workload with Filestore](/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/stateful-workload) .\n", "content": "## Filestore and the GKE Filestore CSI driver\nThe GKE Filestore CSI driver is the primary way for you to use Filestore instances with GKE and provides the following benefits:\n- You have access to fully-managed NFS storage through the Kubernetes APIs ( [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/access-cluster-api) .\n- You can use the GKE Filestore CSI driver to dynamically provision your PersistentVolumes.\n- You can use the GKE Filestore CSI driver to create [CSI volume snapshots](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/persistent-volumes/volume-snapshots) which subsequently create [Filestore backups](/filestore/docs/backups) .\nFor a detailed list of benefits, see [Access instances with the GKE Filestore CSI driver](/filestore/docs/csi-driver) .\n## Filestore multishares for GKE\nFilestore multishares for GKE combined with the [GKE Filestore CSI driver](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/persistent-volumes/filestore-csi-driver) , version 1.27, provides the following benefits:\n- Provides a comprehensive view of your PersistentVolumes as one pool of storage.\n- Supports [dynamic volume provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) , scaling share and instance capacity up or down as needed.\n- Supports multiple shares with smaller, more flexible sizing for improved utilization and cost efficiency of each Filestore instance.\nFor more information, see [Filestore multishares for GKE](/filestore/docs/multishares) .\n## What's next\n- [Deploy a stateful workload with Filestore](/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/stateful-workload) \n- [StorageClasses and dynamic volume provisioning](/filestore/docs/multishares#storageclasses_and_dynamic_volume_provisioning) \n- [Access Filestore instances with the Filestore CSI driver](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/persistent-volumes/filestore-csi-driver) \n- [Filestore multishares for GKE](/filestore/docs/multishares) \n- [Optimize storage with Filestore multishares for GKE](/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/optimize-multishares) \n- [Encrypt your GKE clusters' persistent storage using CMEK](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/using-cmek#create_a_cmek_protected_attached_disk)", "guide": "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)"}
