GKE can use IP masquerading to change the source IP addresses of packets sent from Pods.\nFor a more general overview of IP masquerading in any Kubernetes implementation, see [IP Masquerade Agent User Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/ip-masq-agent/#ip-masquerade-agent-user-guide) .\n## GKE IP masquerading\nWhen IP masquerading applies to a packet emitted by a Pod, GKE changes the packet's source IP address from the Pod IP address to the underlying node's IP address. Masquerading a packet's source IP address is useful when a recipient is configured to receive packets only from the cluster's node IP addresses.\nOn Linux nodes, GKE configures `iptables` rules. GKE uses the `ip-masq-agent` [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) to configure the appropriate dataplane.\nIP masquerading is not supported with Windows Server node pools.\n### IP masquerading for Standard clusters\nIn Standard clusters, the cluster's IP masquerade behavior is governed by three factors:\n- Whether you have deployed or GKE has automatically deployed the [ip-masq-agentDaemonSet](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#check-ip-masq-agent) in the cluster. To learn about the scenarios in which GKE automatically deploys the`ip-masq-agent`DaemonSet, see [When theip-masq-agent is deployed automatically](#when-ip-masq-included) .\n- Whether you have created a [custom nonMasqueradeCIDRs list in theip-masq-agentconfigMap](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#config-ip-masq-agent) .\n- In cases where no`ip-masq-agent`DaemonSet is deployed in the cluster, whether you created the cluster with the`--disable-default-snat`flag. To learn more about this flag, see [Effect of the--disable-default-snat flag](#disable-default-snat-flag) .\nThe following table summarizes IP masquerade configurations for Standard GKE clusters:\n| Cluster configuration                                            | Resulting SNAT behavior                                                                |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The ip-masq-agent DaemonSet is present in the cluster, and a custom nonMasqueradeCIDRs list exists in the ip-masq-agent ConfigMap.                | GKE preserves the source Pod IP addresses for packets sent to destinations specified in the nonMasqueradeCIDRs list. GKE changes source Pod IP addresses to source node IP addresses for packets sent to destinations not specified in the nonMasqueradeCIDRs list.    |\n| The ip-masq-agent DaemonSet is present in the cluster, but a custom nonMasqueradeCIDRs list does not exist in the ip-masq-agent ConfigMap or the ip-masq-agent ConfigMap is not present at all. | GKE preserves the source Pod IP addresses for packets sent to a set of default non-masquerade destinations. GKE changes source Pod IP addresses to source node IP addresses for packets sent to destinations outside of the default non-masquerade destinations.    |\n| The ip-masq-agent DaemonSet is not present in the cluster, and you have created the cluster without the --disable-default-snat flag.                | GKE preserves the source Pod IP addresses for packets sent to a set of default non-masquerade destinations. GKE changes source Pod IP addresses to source node IP addresses for packets sent to destinations outside of the default non-masquerade destinations.    |\n| The ip-masq-agent DaemonSet is not present in the cluster, and you have created the cluster with the --disable-default-snat flag.                | GKE preserves the source Pod IP addresses for packets sent to all destinations. Review Preserving Pod IPv4 address sources to internet destinations for important routing considerations when you preserve Pod IPv4 source addresses and need to route packets to the internet. |\n### IP masquerading for Autopilot clusters\nIn Autopilot clusters, GKE always deploys an `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet. Except for packets sent by Pods to the cluster's node, Pod, or Services ranges, you can control the IP masquerade behavior using an `EgressNATPolicy` . To use an `EgressNATPolicy` , your Autopilot cluster must meet both of these requirements:\n- The cluster must use GKE version 1.23.4-gke.1600 or later, or 1.22.7-gke.1500 or later.\n- The cluster must have been created with [GKE Dataplane V2enabled](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/dataplane-v2#create-cluster) .\nThe following table summarizes IP masquerade configurations for Autopilot GKE clusters:\n| Autopilot cluster configuration                              | Resulting SNAT behavior                                                                                                   |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The cluster includes a custom EgressNATPolicy whose spec.action is NoSNAT containing non-masquerade destinations specified in spec.destinations[]. | GKE preserves the source Pod IP addresses for packets sent to destinations specified in spec.destinations[] of the EgressNATPolicy. GKE accomplishes this by translating spec.destinations[] into a nonMasqueradeCIDRs list in an ip-masq-agent configMap. GKE changes source Pod IP addresses to source node IP addresses for packets sent to destinations not specified in spec.destinations[] of the EgressNATPolicy. |\n| The cluster does not include a custom EgressNATPolicy.                        | The default EgressNATPolicy and Managed by GKE policy both apply, resulting in the following behavior: GKE preserves the source Pod IP addresses for packets sent to a set of default non-masquerade destinations. GKE changes source Pod IP addresses to source node IP addresses for packets sent to destinations outside of the default non-masquerade destinations.             |\n**Note:** Autopilot clusters never perform IP masquerading (SNAT) when sending packets to the cluster's own node, Pod, or Services IP addresses because of the [Managed by GKE EgressNATPolicy](#managed-by-gke-policy) .\n## Configuration examples\nExpand the following sections to see IP masquerading and configuration examples based on cluster type.## Advanced configuration reference\n### When the ip-masq-agent is deployed automatically\nIn Autopilot mode clusters, GKE always deploys an `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet.\nIn Standard clusters, GKE deploys an `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet when the `--disable-default-snat` flag is set and the cluster uses one of the following configuration combinations:\n- The cluster does not use GKE Dataplane V2, and [networkpolicy enforcement](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/network-policy) is enabled.\n- The cluster uses a Pod IP address range that does not fit within `10.0.0.0/8` .\nFor the `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet to be effective, you must also [specify the nonMasqueradeCIDRs list](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#config-ip-masq-agent) in the `ip-masq-agent` ConfigMap. For more information, see [how to configure an IP masquerade agent](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent) .\nWhen a `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet is present in a cluster, GKE updates and reconciles a serving Pod on each node of the cluster.\n### Default non-masquerade destinations\nThe default non-masquerade destination are:\n- `10.0.0.0/8`\n- `172.16.0.0/12`\n- `192.168.0.0/16`\n- `100.64.0.0/10`\n- `192.0.0.0/24`\n- `192.0.2.0/24`\n- `192.88.99.0/24`\n- `198.18.0.0/15`\n- `198.51.100.0/24`\n- `203.0.113.0/24`\n- `240.0.0.0/4`\nThe default non-masquerade destinations are applicable to clusters with the following configurations:\n- Your cluster has an [ip-masq-agentDaemonSet](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#checking_the_ip-masq-agent_daemonset) , but no [nonMasqueradeCIDRslist](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#config-ip-masq-agent) specified in its `ip-masq-agent` ConfigMap. This includes the case where your cluster has an `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet, but does not have an `ip-masq-agent` ConfigMap at all.\n- Your cluster have an [ip-masq-agentDaemonSet](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#checking_the_ip-masq-agent_daemonset) , the [--disable-default-snatflag](/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create#--disable-default-snat) is not set.\nThe default non-masquerade destinations are applicable to clusters with the following configurations:\n- Your cluster has an [ip-masq-agentDaemonSet](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#checking_the_ip-masq-agent_daemonset) , and you have a custom [nonMasqueradeCIDRslist](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#config-ip-masq-agent) specified in the `ip-masq-agent` ConfigMap. A custom `nonMasqueradeCIDRs` list always overrides the default non-masquerade destinations when the cluster has an `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet.\n- Your cluster have an [ip-masq-agentDaemonSet](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#checking_the_ip-masq-agent_daemonset) , the [--disable-default-snatflag](/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create#--disable-default-snat) is set. See [Effect of the --disable-default-snatflag](#disable-default-snat-flag) for more details about this configuration.\n### Effect of the --disable-default-snat flag\nThe [--disable-default-snat](/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create#--disable-default-snat) flag changes the GKE SNAT behavior so that source Pod IP addresses are preserved for packets sent to all destinations. GKE implements the default SNAT behavior by not deploying any `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet in the cluster.\nThe `--disable-default-snat` flag has no effect when a cluster includes an `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet:\n- Because Autopilot clusters always include an`ip-masq-agent`DaemonSet, the`--disable-default-snat`flag has no effect on Autopilot clusters.\n- For Standard clusters: If you [deploy an ip-masq-agentDaemonSet](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#deploy-ip-masq-agent-deamonset) or if [GKE automatically deploys an ip-masq-agentDaemonSet](#when-ip-masq-included) , the`--disable-default-snat`flag has no meaning for the cluster, even if`--disable-default-snat`is set. When an`ip-masq-agent`DaemonSet is present in the cluster, non-masquerade destinations are either explicitly specified in a`nonMasqueradeCIDRs`list of the`ip-masq-agent`ConfigMap or from the [default non-masqueradedestinations](#default-non-masq-dests) when no`nonMasqueradeCIDRs`list is defined.\nYou can set the `--disable-default-snat` flag by updating a cluster after it has been created. Provided that the cluster has no `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet deployed, disabling default SNAT takes effect after the cluster has replaced all of its nodes\u2014sometimes hours later. This is because GKE respects your configured [maintenancewindows](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/maintenance-windows-and-exclusions) when it replaces nodes in the cluster. If you haven't configured any maintenance window, you need to manually cycle the nodes in the cluster before the `--disable-default-snat` flag has any effect.\n### Link-local masquerading\nThe `169.254.0.0/16` range is used for . Link-local masquerading refers to changing a source Pod IP address to a source node IP address for packets sent to the `169.254.0.0/16` destinations.\nAutopilot clusters always preserve source Pod IP addresses for packets sent to `169.254.0.0/16` destinations.\nBy default, Standard clusters also preserve the source Pod IP addresses for packets sent to `169.254.0.0/16` destinations.\nYou can enable link-local IP masquerading in a Standard cluster by doing both of the following:\n- Ensure that the`masqLinkLocal`parameter exists and is set to`True`in the`ip-masq-agent`configMap. When the`masqLinkLocal`parameter is not present in the`ip-masq-agent`configMap, the default is`False`. For guidance, see [Checking the ip-masq-agentConfigMap](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#checking_the_ip-masq-agent_configmap) , [Creating the ip-masq-agentConfigMap](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#creating_the_ip-masq-agent_configmap) , and [Editing an existing ip-masq-agentConfigMap](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#edit-ip-masq-agent-configmap) .\n- Ensure that your cluster has the`ip-masq-agent`DaemonSet deployed. For guidance, see [Checking the ip-masq-agentDaemonSet](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#checking_the_ip-masq-agent_daemonset) and [Deploying the ip-masq-agentDaemonSet](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#deploy-ip-masq-agent-deamonset) .\n**Important:** In Standard clusters, after you enabled link-local IP masquerading, you ou cannot override link-local IP masquerading by adding `169.254.0.0/16` (or any CIDR that fits within `169.254.0.0/16` ) to the `nonMasqueradeCIDRs` list in the `ip-masq-agent` ConfigMap. You also cannot override link-local IP masquerading with the `--disable-default-snat` flag because enabling link-local IP masquerading requires deploying the `ip-masq-agent` DaemonSet, and [the --disable-default-snat flag has no effectwhen an ip-masq-agent DaemonSet exists in thecluster](#disable-default-snat-flag) .\n### Diagnostic containers and Pods with hostNetwork: true\nUnless you specify a custom source IP address for packets, Pods running with `hostNetwork: true` and diagnostic containers send packets with sources matching the node's IP address. For Pods running with `hostNetwork: true` , GKE assigns the Pod the node's IP address. GKE does not manage IP addresses for diagnostic containers, including containers for [debugging node issues usingtoolbox](/container-optimized-os/docs/how-to/toolbox) .\nAutopilot clusters do not support running Pods with `spec.hostNetwork: true` . Because the nodes of an Autopilot cluster are not accessible using SSH, you cannot run diagnostic containers on them.\n### Preserving Pod IPv4 address sources to internet destinations\nIf your cluster's IP masquerade configuration is one of the following, GKE preserves Pod IP address sources for packets sent to all destinations, including internet destinations:\n- In Standard clusters with an`ip-masq-agent`DaemonSet, if you've set the`nonMasqueradeCIDRs`to`0.0.0.0`in the`ip-masq-agent`ConfigMap.\n- In Standard clusters without an`ip-masq-agent`DaemonSet, if you've set the`--disable-default-snat`flag.\n- In Autopilot clusters, if you [edit the defaultEgressNATPolicy](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/egress-nat-policy-ip-masq-autopilot#edit-default-egress-nat-policy) such that the`spec.action`is`NoSNAT`, and the`spec.destinations`contains`Cidr: 0.0.0.0/0`.\nIn both public and private clusters, Pod IPv4 sources are internal IPv4 addresses, which means that they aren't routable on the internet. Consequently, when you preserve source Pod IPv4 addresses for packets sent to the internet, you need to use a technique like one of the following in order to route packets after they leave the nodes of the cluster:\n- Make sure your VPC network has a default route with the default internet gateway next hop, and configure a Cloud NAT gateway to provide public NAT services to at least the subnet secondary IPv4 address ranges used by Pods in your cluster. For more details, see [GKEinteraction](/nat/docs/nat-product-interactions#NATwithGKE) in the Cloud NAT overview.\n- Configure your VPC network to use a custom default route whose next hop is a VM instance or internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, where the VM or backends of the load balancer have been configured to route packets to the internet on behalf of the Pods.## Effect of the Egress NAT policy in Autopilot clusters\nThe GKE lets you configure IP masquerading on Autopilot clusters. You can use the GKE Egress NAT policy custom resource definition (CRD) to change the source IP addresses of packets sent from the Pods.\nFor security or IP address exhaustion reasons, you can masquerade IP addresses from Pod to Node IP address range for outbound traffic to on-premises networks. For example, you can use a non-RFC-1918 range for Autopilot clusters and use a RFC-1918 range for the nodes. However, if Pods must communicate with on-premises networks that also use non-RFC-1918 range, IP addresses can overlap. To avoid traffic loss, you can [configure an Egress NAT Policy](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/egress-nat-policy-ip-masq-autopilot#deploy-new-policy) to not advertise the Pods' non-RFC-1918 ranges to on-premises networks. The Egress NAT Policy masquerades the Pods' non RFC-1918 range to use the Node's RFC-1918 range instead. Ensure that a Node range is not overlapping with any on-premises range or it can cause a traffic loop.\n**Note:** For clusters in Autopilot mode in versions earlier than 1.23.4-gke.1600 or 1.22.7-gke.1500, [RFC-1918 and all reserved addresses](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ip-masquerade-agent#default-non-masq-dests) as destinations are not masqueraded. Changes to the masquerading behavior require special `kube-system` configurations that are not available in Autopilot mode.\nGKE enforces the IP masquerading behavior for Autopilot clusters through the following process:\n- GKE deploys the Egress NAT controller and the`ip-masq-agent`.\n- You create the Egress NAT policy.\n- The GKE controller translates the policy into the`ip-masq-agent`ConfigMap.\n- The`ip-masq-agent`DaemonSet reads the ConfigMap and then GKE enforces the IP masquerading behavior.\n### Automatically generated policies\nGKE supports the following two automatically generated Egress NAT policies:\n- Default: These policies are editable.\n- Managed by GKE: These policies are fixed and are not editable.GKE predefines a set of default IP address ranges. When packets are sent to these destinations, your cluster does not masquerade IP address sources and preserves source Pod IP addresses.

This static range contains the Pod, Service, and Node IP address ranges of the cluster, and might overlap with the default policy.\nYou can identify this policy by a dynamic 8-byte hash ( `gke-{CLUSTER_SHORT_HASH}` ) that GKE assigns.
