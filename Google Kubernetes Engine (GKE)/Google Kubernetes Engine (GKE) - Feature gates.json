Feature gates are a set of key-value pairs that toggle Kubernetes features. You can't modify Kubernetes feature gates in GKE clusters.\nThe Kubernetes project releases new features in [stages](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages) over time. Features can be in the , , or stage.\nTo see what features are enabled for your cluster running version 1.26 or later, [check the feature gate state](#check-feature-gate-state) .\nAlternatively, to verify the stage of a feature corresponding to the version of your cluster's control plane or nodes, check the [Feature gates for Alpha orBetafeatures](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-gates-for-alpha-or-beta-features) table in the Kubernetes documentation.\n#", "content": "## GA Kubernetes features in GKE\nGA (also referred to as ) Kubernetes features are on GKE by default and .\n### Beta Kubernetes features in GKE\nBeta features are usually by default in GKE. GKE might disable a specific beta feature for a particular version to mitigate a known issue with the feature, to ensure backwards compatibility, or because integration and qualification of the feature in GKE is not yet complete.\nIf you want to use a beta Kubernetes feature in your GKE cluster running version 1.26 or later, check that this feature is enabled by [checkingthe feature gate state](#check-feature-gate-state) . If your cluster is running a version earlier than 1.26, you can check if the feature is enabled by testing the feature.\n[Contact Cloud Customer Care](/support) if you can't verify whether the beta feature is enabled for your GKE cluster's control plane or node version.\n### Alpha Kubernetes features in GKE\nAlpha Kubernetes features are disabled by default in all GKE clusters. GKE might enable a specific alpha feature in a specific control plane version.\nTo enable all alpha Kubernetes features, create an [alpha Standard cluster](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/alpha-clusters) .\n**Warning:** Alpha clusters are intended for experimental purposes and not for production workloads.\n## Check feature gate state\nWith clusters running version 1.26 or later, you can run a `kubectl` command to check what features are enabled.\nCheck the feature gate state for your GKE cluster:\n- [Install and configure kubectl access](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl) \n- Run the following command:```\nkubectl get --raw /metrics | grep kubernetes_feature_enabled\n```The output, like in the following example, shows you the name of the feature gate, the corresponding stage ( `\"\"` is GA), and whether the feature gate is enabled. `1` means enabled and `0` means disabled.See the following example output:```\n# HELP kubernetes_feature_enabled [BETA] This metric records the data about the stage and enablement of a k8s feature.\n# TYPE kubernetes_feature_enabled gauge\nkubernetes_feature_enabled{name=\"APIListChunking\",stage=\"\"} 1\nkubernetes_feature_enabled{name=\"APIPriorityAndFairness\",stage=\"\"} 1\nkubernetes_feature_enabled{name=\"APIResponseCompression\",stage=\"BETA\"} 1\nkubernetes_feature_enabled{name=\"APISelfSubjectReview\",stage=\"\"} 1\nkubernetes_feature_enabled{name=\"APIServerIdentity\",stage=\"BETA\"} 1\nkubernetes_feature_enabled{name=\"APIServerTracing\",stage=\"BETA\"} 1\nkubernetes_feature_enabled{name=\"AdmissionWebhookMatchConditions\",stage=\"BETA\"} 1\n...\n```This output indicates that, for example, the `APIResponseCompression` feature is enabled and in the beta stage.## What's next\n- For a complete list of current Kubernetes features, see [Featuregates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-gates-for-alpha-or-beta-features) .\n- For a full list of GKE features, refer to the [GKE release notes](/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes) .", "guide": "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)"}
