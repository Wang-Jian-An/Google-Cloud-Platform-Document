How  you authenticate to Google Kubernetes Engine depends on the interface you use to access the API  and the environment where your code is running.\nTo interact with like Pods and Services, you must authenticate to the Kubernetes API, which is separate to the GKE API and is served by the Kubernetes API server in each cluster. For instructions, see [Authenticate to the Kubernetes API server](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/api-server-authentication) .\nTo access other Google Cloud resources like Cloud Storage buckets from workloads running in GKE, use [workload identity federation for GKE](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) .\nFor more information about Google Cloud authentication, see the [authentication overview](/docs/authentication) .\n", "content": "## API access\nGKE supports programmatic access. You can access the API in  the following ways:\n- [Client libraries](#client-libraries) \n- [Google Cloud CLI](#gcloud) \n- [REST](#rest) \n### Client libraries\nThe [GKE client libraries](/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/libraries) provide   high-level language support for authenticating to GKE   programmatically.   To authenticate calls to Google Cloud APIs, client libraries support [Application Default Credentials (ADC)](/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) ; the libraries look for credentials in a set of defined locations and use those credentials to authenticate requests to the API. With ADC, you can make credentials available to your application in a variety of environments, such as local development or production, without needing to modify your application code.\n### Google Cloud CLI\nWhen you use the [gcloud CLI](/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters) to access   GKE, you [log in to the gcloud CLI](/sdk/docs/authorizing) with a Google   Account, which provides the credentials used by the gcloud CLI commands.\nIf your organization's security policies prevent user accounts from having the required   permissions, you can use [service account impersonation](#sa-impersonation) .\nFor more information, see [Authenticate for using the gcloud CLI](/docs/authentication/gcloud) .   For more information about using the gcloud CLI with GKE,   see [the gcloud CLI reference pages](/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters) .\n### REST\nYou can authenticate to [the GKEAPI](/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest) by using your gcloud CLI credentials or by using [Application Default Credentials](/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) .   For more information about authentication for REST requests, see [Authenticate for using REST](/docs/authentication/rest) .   For information about the types of credentials, see [gcloud CLI credentials and ADC credentials](/docs/authentication/gcloud#gcloud-credentials) .\n## What's next\n- [Authenticate to the Kubernetes API server](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/api-server-authentication) .\n- [Use external identity providers to authenticate to GKE](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/oidc) .\n- [Authenticate to Google Cloud APIs from GKE using workload identity federation for GKE](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) .\n- [Learn about access control in GKE and Kubernetes](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/access-control) .\n- [Learn about the GKE API and the Kubernetes API](/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/api-organization) .\n- Learn about [Google Cloud authentication methods](/docs/authentication#auth-decision-tree) .\n- See a list of [authentication use cases](/docs/authentication/use-cases) .", "guide": "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)"}
