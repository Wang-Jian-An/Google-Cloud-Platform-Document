Exceeding the limits may affect the performance of your cluster or in same cases even cause downtimes. Follow the best practices and execute recommended actions to ensure your clusters run your workloads reliably at scale.\n## Best practices for splitting workloads between multiple clusters\nYou can run your workloads on a single, large cluster. This approach is easier to manage, more cost efficient, and provides better resource utilization than multiple clusters. However, in some cases you need to consider splitting your workload into multiple clusters:\n- Review [Multi-cluster use cases](/anthos/fleet-management/docs/multi-cluster-use-cases) to learn more about general requirements and scenarios for using multiple clusters.\n- In addition, from the scalability point of view, split your cluster when it could exceed one of the limits described in the section below or one of [GKE quotas](/kubernetes-engine/quotas) . Lowering any risk to reach the GKE limits, reduces the risk of downtime or other reliability issues.\nIf you decide to split your cluster, use [Fleet management](/anthos/fleet-management/docs) to simplify management of a multi-cluster fleet.\n## Limits and best practices\nTo ensure that your architecture supports large-scale GKE clusters, review the following limits and related best practices. Exceeding these limits may cause degradation of cluster performance or reliability issues.\nThese best practices apply to any default Kubernetes cluster with no extensions installed. Extending Kubernetes clusters with webhooks or [custom resource definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) is common but can constrain your ability to scale the cluster.\nThe following table extends the main [GKE quotas and limits](/kubernetes-engine/quotas#limits_per_cluster) . You should also familiarize yourself with the open-source [Kubernetes limits](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md) for large-scale clusters.\nThe GKE version requirements mentioned in the table apply to both the nodes and the control plane.\n| GKE limit                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                 | Best practices                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The etcd database size                 | The maximum size of the etcd database is 6\u00a0GB. If you are running a very large cluster with tens of thousands of resources, your etcd instances might exceed this limit. You can check the utilization level for your clusters in the Google Cloud console.                                                                                                    | If you cross this limit, GKE might mark your etcd instances as unhealthy. This causes the clusters control plane to be unresponsive. If you cross this limit, contact Google Cloud support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Total size of etcd objects per type              | The total size of all objects of the given resource type should not exceed 800\u00a0MB. For example, you can create 750\u00a0MB of Pod instances and 750\u00a0MB of Secrets, but you cannot create 850\u00a0MB of Secrets. If you create more than 800\u00a0MB of objects, this could lead your Kubernetes or customized controllers to fail to initialize and cause disruptions.                                                                             | Keep the total size of all objects of each type stored in etcd below 800\u00a0MB. This is especially applicable to clusters using many large-sized Secrets or ConfigMaps, or a high volume of CRDs. Note:Helm uses Secrets as the default release information storage. In large clusters, the use of Helm can often lead to exceeding the limit of Secrets or ConfigMaps total size. Use Helm's SQL storage backend instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Number of Services for clusters where GKE Dataplane V2 is not enabled      | The performance of iptables used by kube-proxy degrades if any of the following occurs: There are too many Services. The number of backends behind a Service is high. This limit is eliminated when GKE Dataplane V2 is enabled.                                                                                                           | Keep the number of Services in the cluster below 10,000.

The larger a cluster, the more change-related data the agent processes. This is especially visible in clusters with more than 500 nodes. Information about the endpoints is split between separate EndpointSlices. This split reduces the amount of data transferred on each change. Endpoint objects are still available for components, but any endpoint above 1,000 Pods is automatically truncated.                                            | Keep the number of Pods behind a single Service lower than 10,000.

Additional factors like deleting a pod that is a part of a Service also can impact this Pod churn rate. For clusters with up to 500 nodes, you can expect an average rate of 20 pods created per second and 20 pods deleted per second. For clusters larger than 500 nodes, you can expect an average rate of 100 pods created per second and 100 pods deleted per second.                                          | Take the Pod creation and deletion rate limit under consideration when planning how to scale your workloads. Pods share the same deletion throughput with other resource types (for example, EndpointSlices). You can reduce deletion throughput when you define Pods as part of a Service. To allow Cluster Autoscaler to effectively remove pods from underutilized nodes, avoid too restrictive PodDisruptionBudgets and long termination grace periods. Wildcard Tolerations are also discouraged, as they can cause workloads to be scheduled on nodes that are in the process of being removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Number of open watches                 | Nodes create a watch for every Secret and ConfigMaps you configure for Pods. The combined amount of watches created by all nodes might generate substantial load on the cluster control plane. Having more than 200,000 watches per cluster might affect the initialization time of the cluster. This issue can cause the control plane to frequently restart.                                                                            | Define larger nodes to decrease the likelihood and severity of issues caused by a large number of watches. Higher pod density (fewer large-sized nodes) might reduce the number of watches and mitigate the severity of the issue.

The default limit varies between 100\u00a0Kbps and 500\u00a0Kbps depending on the load. You can lift the limit to 10\u00a0Mbps by deploying a high-throughput Logging agent configuration. Going beyond this limit may cause log entries to be dropped.                                                                                   | Configure your Logging to stay within the default limits or configure a high throughput Logging agent.

Config Connector has two modes of operation: Cluster mode, where there is a single Config Connector instance per GKE cluster. In this mode, a single Config Connector instance loads all the resources. Namespace mode, where each namespace within a cluster has a separate Config Connector instance. In this mode, you can partition managed resources via namespaces. This setup reduces the amount of resources that a single Config Connector instance needs to manage, lowering its CPU and memory usage. Each mode has different scalability characteristic and limitations. | Each Config Connector instance has 0.1 CPU request and 512\u00a0MB memory limit. Therefore, it does not scale well to a large amount of managed resources. We recommend having no more than 25,000 Google Cloud resources per single Config Connector instance. This limitation is for reference purposes only because the amount of memory used depends on the type of resource and specific use cases. When managing a larger number of managed resources, we recommend using the namespace mode to limit the number of resources handled by each Config Connector instance. We recommend using up to 500 namespaces with Config Connector in the namespace mode. Each Config Connector instance opens many watch connections to the kube-apiserver. A large number of these instances may overload the GKE cluster control plane, especially during control plane upgrades, when watch connections need to be reinitialized. The number of 500 namespaces may be further limited in new GKE clusters, because CPU and memory available for the cluster control plane is based initially on the number of nodes in the cluster. The cluster needs time to adjust the CPU and memory available based on utilization. We recommend using multiple GKE clusters to manage the number of resources that could not be divided to fit in the limits specified above.
