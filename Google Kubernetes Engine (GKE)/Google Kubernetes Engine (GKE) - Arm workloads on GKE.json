You can run single-architecture Arm images or multi-architecture (multi-arch) images compatible with both x86 and Arm processors. To learn about the benefits of Arm, see [Arm VMs on Compute](/compute/docs/instances/arm-on-compute) .\nSee the following guides for more information about choosing workloads to deploy on Arm and preparing those workloads for deployment:\n- **Choosing workloads to run on Arm** : Arm nodes are a good choice for scale-out and compute-intensive workloads. To learn more about what types of workloads work well with Arm, see [Workload Recommendations](/compute/docs/instances/arm-on-compute#workload_recommendations) .\n- **Deploying across architectures** : With GKE, you can use multi-arch images to easily deploy one image manifest across nodes with different architectures, including Arm.- To ensure that your container image is Arm-compatible and can run on your targeted architectures, see [Build multi-architecture images for Arm workloads](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/build-multi-arch-for-arm) .\n- To follow a tutorial for using multi-arch images to deploy across architectures, see [Migrate x86 application on GKE to multi-arch with Arm](/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/migrate-x86-to-multi-arch-arm) .\n- **Preparing Arm workloads for deployment** : Once you have an Arm-compatible image, use node affinity rules and node selectors to make sure your workload is scheduled to nodes with a compatible architecture type.- **Autopilot clusters** : see [Deploy Autopilot workloads on Arm architecture](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/autopilot-arm-workloads) .\n- **Standard clusters** : see [Prepare an Arm workload for deployment](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/prepare-arm-workloads-for-deployment) .\n## Requirements and limitations\n- To create a cluster with Arm nodes, you must use GKE version 1.24 or later.\n- Arm nodes are available in the following Google Cloud regions:- us-central1 (Iowa - Zone A, B, F)\n- europe-west4 (Netherlands - Zone A, B)\n- asia-southeast1 (Singapore - Zone B, C)\n- GKE doesn't support the following features with T2A nodes:- [Confidential GKE Nodes](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/confidential-gke-nodes) \n- [Container Threat Detection](/security-command-center/docs/concepts-container-threat-detection-overview) \n- [Filestore CSI driver](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/persistent-volumes/filestore-csi-driver) \n- [GPUs](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/gpus) \n- [GKE Windows](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/windows-server-gke) \n- [Local SSDs](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/persistent-volumes/local-ssd) \n- [Managed Service for Prometheus](/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus) \n- [Policy Controller](/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/policy-controller) , [Config Sync](/anthos-config-management/docs/config-sync-overview) , and [Config Controller](/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/config-controller-overview) The following limitations apply to GKE Standard clusters:\n- Support for [metrics-server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/resource-usage-monitoring/#resource-metrics-pipeline) on Arm nodes is available on GKE version 1.24.2-gke.300 and later. If you need metrics-server functionality on an earlier version, add a node pool with x86 nodes to schedule metrics-server.\n- Support for [Ubuntu OS node images](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-images#available_node_images) on Arm nodes is available on GKE version 1.24.3-gke.2400 and later.\n- Support for [Image streaming](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/image-streaming) on Arm nodes is available on GKE version 1.24.4-gke.800 and later.\n- Support for [GKE Sandbox](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/sandbox-pods) on Arm nodes is available in the following GKE versions:- 1.24.5-gke.600 and later\n- 1.25.1-gke.500 and later\n## What's next\n- [Create clusters and node pools with Arm nodes](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/create-arm-clusters-nodes) \n- [Build multi-architecture images for Arm workloads](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/build-multi-arch-for-arm) \n- [Prepare an Arm workload for deployment](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/prepare-arm-workloads-for-deployment) \n- [Migrate x86 application on GKE to multi-arch with Arm](/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/migrate-x86-to-multi-arch-arm)", "guide": "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)"}
