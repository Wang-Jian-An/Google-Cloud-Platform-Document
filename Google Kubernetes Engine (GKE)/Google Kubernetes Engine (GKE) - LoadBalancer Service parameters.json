If unspecified, the Kubernetes control plane assigns a health check port from the node port range. Note: Either the kube-proxy (legacy Dataplane) or cilium-agent (GKE Dataplane V2) responds to packets sent to the health check node port. Health checks for LoadBalancer Services cannot be answered by serving Pods. |\n**Warning:** Don't customize the external passthrough Network Load Balancer or internal passthrough Network Load Balancer by modifying its health check resource outside of GKE. GKE does not offer any other customization parameters for load balancer health checks created for LoadBalancer Services.\n### Firewall rules and source IP address allowlist\nWhen you create a LoadBalancer Service, GKE creates a [VPC firewall rule corresponding to the Service](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/firewall-rules#service-fws) . Each firewall rule has the following characteristics:\n- The firewall rule's direction is ingress, and its action is allow. The [implied deny ingress firewallrules](/vpc/docs/firewalls#default_firewall_rules) in Google Cloud mean that GKE uses an allowlist model when creating ingress firewall rules.\n- GKE sets the firewall rule's protocol and destination port to those specified in the Service's`spec.ports[]`list.\n- GKE sets the destination for the firewall rule by setting its [target parameter](/vpc/docs/firewalls#sources_or_destinations_for_the_rule) to the virtual IP address of the LoadBalancer.\n- If the Service includes`spec.loadBalancerSourceRanges[]`, GKE sets the firewall rule's source parameter to the IP addresses in that list. If the Service does not include`loadBalancerSourceRanges[]`, GKE sets the firewall rule's source parameter to all IP addresses`(0.0.0.0/0)`.\n**Important:** For an ingress firewall rule, the target parameter defines destination IP addresses as [all IP addresses associated with a VM](/vpc/docs/firewalls#targets_and_ips_ingress) , not just the IP address of an individual load balancer.\nThe firewall rule created for a LoadBalancer Service allows packets, matching that Service's protocol and destination ports, to the Service's virtual IP address.\nWhen a cluster contains two or more Services that share at least one common protocol and destination port, the effective set of source ranges is the union of `loadBalancerSourceRanges` for all Services that specify that protocol and destination port combination. This is because the target parameter of an ingress firewall rule defines the destination IP addresses as [all IP addresses associated with a VM](/vpc/docs/firewalls#targets_and_ips) .\nConsider a cluster that has two LoadBalancer Services:\n- The first Service's`spec.ports[0].port`is TCP port`80`, and its`spec.loadBalancerSourceRanges=[100.10.0.0/16]`. The resulting load balancer corresponding to this Service has IP address`192.0.2.2`.\n- The second Service's`spec.ports[0].port`is TCP port`80`,`spec.ports[1].port`is TCP port`90`, and its`spec.loadBalancerSourceRanges=[172.16.0.0/24]`. The resulting load balancer corresponding to this Service has IP address`198.51.100.3`.\nGKE creates two ingress-allow firewall rules in the cluster's Virtual Private Cloud network. Both firewall rules specify all nodes of the cluster as their targets:\n- The first firewall rule allows packets to TCP destination port`80`from source`100.10.0.0/16`.\n- The second firewall rule allows packets to TCP destination ports`80`and`90`from source`172.16.0.0/24`.\nThe first forwarding rule routes traffic matching the `192.0.2.2:80` destination. The second forwarding rule routes traffic matching both the `198.51.100.3:80` and `198.51.100.3:90` destinations. All three of the following are valid destinations on each node: `192.0.2.2:80` , `198.51.100.3:80` , and `198.51.100.3:90` . This means that:\n- Both Services accept packets to TCP port`80`from theof the IP address source ranges, from either`100.10.0.0/16`or`172.16.0.0/24`.\n- The second Service accepts packets to TCP port`90`from`172.16.0.0/24`.\nThe effective set of source ranges for all Services using the same protocol and destination port combination becomes all IP addresses if `spec.loadBalancerSourceRanges` is omitted on at least one Service using that protocol and destination port combination. For example, If the second Service had omitted `spec.loadBalancerSourceRanges` , the second firewall's source would be `0.0.0.0/0` , and:\n- Both Services would accept packets to TCP port 80 from the union of the IP address source ranges, from either`100.10.0.0/16`or`0.0.0.0/0`. Because the`0.0.0.0/0`range includes the`100.10.0.0/16`range, the effective source for packets to TCP port 80 is any IP address.\n- The second Service would accept packets to TCP port`90`from`0.0.0.0/0`(any IP address).\n### Static IP addresses\nYou can [create a static IPaddress](/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/addresses/create) and configure GKE to assign that static address to the load balancer's forwarding rule. Using a static IP address ensures that the load balancer's IP address remains the same even if you make changes to the LoadBalancer Service. Without a static IP address, GKE might assign a different IP address to the load balancer forwarding rule when you update a LoadBalancer Service. The forwarding rule IP address is the same as the Service's `spec.clusterIP` address. The ClusterIP address for a Service never changes when you update a LoadBalancer Service.\nTo instruct a LoadBalancer Service to use a static IP address, use either the `spec.loadBalancerIP` parameter or the `networking.gke.io/load-balancer-ip-addresses` annotation. In GKE version 1.29 and later, the annotation takes precedence over `spec.loadBalancerIP` if the Service manifest contains both the parameter and the annotation.\n| Parameter or annotation and value                                                                                            | Requirements and capabilities                                                                                                                                                  |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| spec.loadBalancerIP: IPv4_ADDRESS                                                                                            | You can specify a static internal IPv4 address for an IPv4-only Internal LoadBalancer Service. You can specify a static external IPv4 address for an IPv4-only External LoadBalancer Service. The parameter works with all supported GKE versions.                                                                                            |\n| networking.gke.io/load-balancer-ip-addresses: IP_ADDRESS_RESOURCE_NAME For single-stack LoadBalancer Services, set the value of the annotation to the IPv4 or IPv6 address resource name, not the IP address itself. For dual-stack LoadBalancer Services, set the value of the annotation to the static IPv4 address resource name and the static IPv6 address range resource name separated by a comma. | You can specify static IPv4 address, static IPv6 address range, or both for IPv4-only, IPv6-only, and dual-stack Internal and External LoadBalancer Services. The annotation requires GKE 1.29 or later and the following additional requirements: To use this annotation with an Internal LoadBalancer Service, you must create the Internal LoadBalancer Service in a cluster after enabling GKE subsetting. To use this annotation with an External LoadBalancer Service, you must include the cloud.google.com/l4-rbs: \"enabled\" annotation in the Service manifest when you create the External LoadBalancer Service. |\nTwo or more LoadBalancer Services can reference the same static IP address if the forwarding rule for each load balancer uses a unique combination of IP address, protocol, port specification, and Network Service Tiers specification, as indicated in the table in this section. Additionally:\n- Static IPv6 addresses are actually `/96` IPv6 address ranges, but GKE only configures nodes to accept packets on the first IPv6 address ( `/128` ) in the `/96` range.\n- For two or more Internal LoadBalancer Services to use the same internal IPv4 address or internal IPv6 address range, the static IP address must be created with the `SHARED_LOADBALANCER_VIP` purpose.\n| Unnamed: 0   | Internal LoadBalancer Service                                                                                                                  | External LoadBalancer Service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Port specification | Forwarding rules for internal passthrough Network Load Balancers support up to five discrete port numbers, or they can be configured to use all ports. When an internal LoadBalancer Service has six or more spec.ports[] specified, GKE configures the forwarding rule for the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer to use all ports. When a forwarding rule uses all ports, no other forwarding rule (therefore, no other internal LoadBalancer Service) can use the same IP address. | GKE creates a target pool based external passthrough Network Load Balancer if the LoadBalancer Service manifest lacks the cloud.google.com/l4-rbs: \"enabled\" annotation. Forwarding rules for target pool based external passthrough Network Load Balancers must use contiguous port ranges. The contiguous port range includes all ports the Service needs, but the range might also include additional ports not used by the Service. For example, an external LoadBalancer Service powered by a target pool based external passthrough Network Load Balancer which specifies ports 80 and 443 in its Service manifest uses a load balancer forwarding rule with a port range of 80-443. This port range prevents other external LoadBalancer Services from using any of the ports 80, 443, and any of the numbers between 80 and 443. GKE creates a backend service based external passthrough Network Load Balancer if the LoadBalancer Service manifest includes the cloud.google.com/l4-rbs: \"enabled\" annotation. Forwarding rules for backend service-based external passthrough Network Load Balancers support up to five discrete port numbers, a contiguous port range, or they can be configured to use all ports. |\n| Network Service Tiers | Not configurable\u2014internal addresses are always Premium tier.                                                                                                          | Configurable for static regional external IPv4 addresses. Static regional external IPv6 address ranges can only be created in the Premium tier. The Network Service Tiers specification of the static external IP address must match either: The tier specified in the LoadBalancer Service manifest's cloud.google.com/network-tier annotation, if that annotation is present in the manifest, or The project's default tier, if the cloud.google.com/network-tier annotation is absent from the LoadBalancer Service manifest. The project's default tier is Premium, unless you have configured it differently.                                                                                                                                                     |\n### LoadBalancer subnet\nYou can configure an Internal LoadBalancer Service to use an ephemeral or static IPv4 address, IPv6 address range, or both, in a custom subnet located in the same region and VPC network as the cluster. Use a custom subnet for an Internal LoadBalancer Service to:\n- Group internal passthrough Network Load Balancers created by Internal LoadBalancer Services from two or more GKE clusters in the same VPC network and region.\n- Create Internal LoadBalancer Services whose internal passthrough Network Load Balancers have IPv4 addresses separate from the cluster's node IPv4 addresses.\n- In a dual-stack cluster, create Internal LoadBalancer Services whose internal passthrough Network Load Balancers have IPv6 address ranges separate from the cluster's node and Pod IPv6 addresses. A custom LoadBalancer subnet is mandatory to support Internal LoadBalancer Services if the cluster's subnet has anIPv6 address range.\nYou can configure an External LoadBalancer Service to use an ephemeral or static IPv6 address range in a custom subnet located in the same region and VPC network as the cluster. Use a custom subnet to create External LoadBalancer Services whose external passthrough Network Load Balancers have IPv6 address ranges separate from the cluster's node and Pod IPv6 addresses. A custom LoadBalancer subnet is mandatory to support External LoadBalancer Services in a dual-stack private cluster because the cluster's subnet has an IPv6 address range.\n**Note:** The custom subnet annotation has no effect on the selection of the external IPv4 address for an External LoadBalancer Service because IPv4 addresses for external passthrough Network Load Balancers are not sourced from subnet ranges of a VPC network.\nUse one of the following annotations to instruct a LoadBalancer Service to use an ephemeral or static IP address in a custom subnet. If a LoadBalancer Service manifest includes both annotations, the `networking.gke.io/load-balancer-subnet` annotation takes precedence provided that its annotation requirements are met.\n| Annotation and value             | Requirements and capabilities                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| networking.gke.io/internal-load-balancer-subnet: SUBNET_RESOURCE_NAME | You can only use the annotation to specify a custom subnet for an IPv4-only Internal LoadBalancer Service.

When global access is disabled, clients that need to access the load balancer must be located in the same region and VPC network, or a network connected to the cluster's VPC network.\nWhen the `networking.gke.io/internal-load-balancer-allow-global-access` annotation is `true` for an internal LoadBalancer Service, GKE enables the global access option on the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer's forwarding rule. Clients located in any region of the VPC network or a network connected to the cluster's VPC network can access the load balancer.\nFor more information about how global access applies to clients in a connected network, see:\n- [Client access](/load-balancing/docs/internal#client-access) in the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer documentation\n- [Internal passthrough Network Load Balancers and connected networks](/load-balancing/docs/internal/internal-tcp-udp-lb-and-other-networks) \n### All ports forwarding rules\nForwarding rules for internal passthrough Network Load Balancers support five unique port numbers or all ports.\nIn GKE clusters with GKE subsetting disabled, an internal LoadBalancer Service can only support five unique ports in the Service's `spec.ports[].port` .\nIn GKE clusters with GKE subsetting enabled, an internal LoadBalancer Service can only support up to 100 ports in the Service's `spec.ports[].port` . For internal LoadBalancer Services with between six and 100 unique `spec.ports[].port` entries, GKE configures the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer's forwarding rule to use all ports since its creation. The GKE controller enables all ports on the forwarding rule because the Service has more than five ports. When configuring a forwarding rule to use all ports, GKE only creates ingress allow firewall rules for the specific ports configured in `spec.ports[].port` on the Service.\nFor more information about internal passthrough Network Load Balancer forwarding rules and valid port specifications, see [Forwarding rules and portspecifications](/load-balancing/docs/internal#all_ports) .\n### IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack LoadBalancer Service\nYou can create an internal or external LoadBalancer Service that can be single-stack (IPv4 only or IPv6 only) or dual-stack. Single-stack LoadBalancer Services create a single forwarding rule with either an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. Dual-stack LoadBalancer Services create two forwarding rules: one with an IPv4 address, and another with an IPv6 address. To create a IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack LoadBalancer Service, deploy it on a [IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack cluster](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/alias-ips#dual-stack) and complete any of the following depending on the type of load balancer you use:\n- For internal LoadBalancer Services, you must have GKE subsetting enabled. For more information see, enabling [internal load balancer subsetting](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/internal-load-balancing#enabling_internal_load_balancer_subsetting_in_a_new_cluster) .\n- For external LoadBalancer Services, you must use a backend service-based external passthrough Network Load Balancer which uses regional backend services. For more information, see [backend service-based external network load balancer](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/external-svc-lb-rbs#backend_service-based_external) .\nFor each Service, you can define `ipFamilyPolicy` and `ipFamilies` specs. To learn more, see [IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/#services) .- LoadBalancer Services with IPv6 addresses are only supported on clusters with stack type`ipv4-ipv6`. For more information, learn how to [Use a dual-stack IP address for a VPC-native cluster](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/alias-ips#dual-stack) .\n- LoadBalancer Services created with a single-stack address cannot be upgraded to dual-stack Services.\n- LoadBalancer Services created with a dual-stack addresses can be changed to single stack according to the following conditions:- A Service with ipFamilies`[\"IPv4\",\"IPv6\"]`can be changed to a Service with ipFamilies`IPv4`but not`IPv6`.\n- A Service with ipFamilies`[\"IPv6\",\"IPv4\"]`can be changed to a Service with ipFamilies`IPv6`but not`IPv4`.", "guide": "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)"}
