If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest  version by running`gcloud components update`. **Note:** For existing gcloud CLI  installations, make sure to set the`compute/region`and`compute/zone` [properties](/sdk/docs/properties#setting_properties) . By setting default locations,  you can avoid errors in gcloud CLI like the following:`One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location`.## Deleting a cluster\nTo delete a cluster using the Google Cloud CLI, run the following command:\n```\ngcloud container clusters delete CLUSTER_NAME\n```\nReplace `` with the name of the cluster that you want to delete.\nFor more information, refer to the [gcloud container clusters delete](/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/delete) documentation.\nTo delete a cluster using the Google Cloud console, perform the following steps:- Go to the **Google Kubernetes Engine** page in the Google Cloud console. [Go to Google Kubernetes Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list) \n- Next to the cluster you want to delete, click **Actions** , then click **Delete** .\n- When prompted to confirm, click **Delete** again.\nTo delete multiple clusters at once, select them and click **Delete** . When prompted to confirm, click **Delete** again.\n## What's next\n- [Learn more about clusters](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture) .", "guide": "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)"}
