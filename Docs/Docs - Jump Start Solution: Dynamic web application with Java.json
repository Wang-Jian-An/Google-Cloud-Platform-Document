{"title": "Docs - Jump Start Solution: Dynamic web application with Java", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/architecture/application-development/gke-java-spring-dynamic-webapp", "abstract": "# Docs - Jump Start Solution: Dynamic web application with Java\nLast reviewed 2023-08-21 UTC\n**    Preview    \u2014 Jump Start Solution ** This feature is subject to the \"Pre-GA Offerings Terms\" in the General Service Terms section   of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) .     Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nThis guide helps you understand, deploy, and use the [dynamic web application with Java](https://console.cloud.google.com/products/solutions/details/dynamic-java-web-application) Jump Start Solution. This solution deploys a dynamic web app named . Point of Sale is a web app written in Java that mimics a real-world point of sale screen for a retail store. After you deploy the web app, you can test the user experience on the Point of Sale screen.\nYou deploy Point of Sale web app in Google Cloud using the Google-managed implementation of Kubernetes, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). With GKE, you can choose how granular the operational management of your infrastructure should be.\nThis solution provides high-level requirements to start your application software design. At the end of this guide, you will be able to select the Google Cloud components required for a deployment with similar cost, performance, and scalability.\nThis guide assumes that you're familiar with Java and basic cloud concepts, though not necessarily Google Cloud. Experience with Terraform is helpful.\n**Note:** This solution helps you explore the capabilities of Google Cloud. The solution is not intended to be used as is for production environments. For information about designing and setting up production-grade environments in Google Cloud, see [Landing zone design in Google Cloud](/architecture/landing-zones) and [Google Cloud setup checklist](/docs/enterprise/setup-checklist) .\n", "content": "## Objectives\nThis solution guide helps you do the following:\n- Deploy a publicly accessible web application with GKE by completing the following high-level tasks:- Configure a GKE Autopilot cluster that responds to the scaling, security, and infrastructure needs of the cluster.\n- Configure a Google Cloud LoadBalancer through Kubernetes Services to enable incoming and outgoing traffic to the web application.\n- Connect to Spanner from a GKE Pod following Google Cloud's recommended security practices.\n- Build and redeploy securely.\n- Explore your deployment.\n- Use Cloud Trace to understand and manage problems.## Products used\nThe solution uses the following Google Cloud products:\n- [Google Kubernetes Engine](/kubernetes-engine) : A managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Google infrastructure.\n- [Spanner](/spanner) : A fully managed relational database that lets your application scale and ensure high availability.\n- [Virtual Private Cloud](/vpc) : A global virtual private cloud network that spans all Google Cloud regions and that lets you interconnect your cloud resources.\nFor information about how these products are configured and how they interact, see the next section.\n## Architecture\nThe following diagram shows the architecture of the Google Cloud resources that the solution deploys:### Components and configuration\nThe architecture includes the following components:\n- A client request goes to [Cloud Load Balancing](/load-balancing) , which distributes incoming traffic to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).\n- Google Cloud assigns an [external IP address](/compute/docs/ip-addresses) to the VPC instance.\n- The VPC provides connectivity to the resources of a GKE Autopilot cluster. The cluster has a Kubernetes Service of type`LoadBalancer`. This Service routes requests to the Pods running three Spring Boot Java service Pods.\n- The Pods have the following characteristics:- The`api-server`Pod hosts the static content for the Vue.js frontend and exposes an API for the frontend. Calls to these APIs trigger connections to the inventory and payment services as needed.\n- The`inventory`service Pod connects to Spanner to store and retrieve inventory information.\n- The`payment`service Pod connects to Spanner to store payment details and generates a purchase bill.\n- The Spanner instance hosts inventory and payment data.## Cost\nFor an estimate of the cost of the Google Cloud resources that the dynamic web application with Java solution uses, see the precalculated estimate in the [Google Cloud Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator#id=d0b8f678-503b-46f5-ada6-46a4690ceaf8) .\nUse the estimate as a starting point to calculate the cost of your deployment. You can modify the estimate to reflect any configuration changes that you plan to make for the resources that are used in the solution.\nThe precalculated estimate is based on assumptions for certain factors, including the following:\n- The Google Cloud locations where the resources are deployed.\n- The amount of time that the resources are used.## Deploy the solution\nThis section guides you through the process of deploying the solution.\n### Create or choose a Google Cloud project\nWhen you deploy the solution, you choose the [Google Cloud project](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) where the resources are deployed. When you're deciding whether to use an existing project or to create a new project, consider the following factors:\n- If you create a project for the solution, then when you no longer need the deployment, you can delete the project and avoid continued billing. If you use an existing project, you must delete the deployment when you no longer need it.\n- Using a new project can help avoid conflicts with previously provisioned resources, such as resources that are used for production workloads.\nIf you want to deploy the solution in a new project, create the project you begin the deployment.\nTo create a project, complete the following steps:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the project selector page. [Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard) \n- To begin creating a   Google Cloud project, click **Create project** .\n- Name your project. Make a note of your generated project ID.\n- Edit the other fields as needed.\n- To create the project, click **Create** .\nTo start the deployment process, you need the Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions that are listed in the following table. If you have the `roles/owner` [basic role](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#basic) for the project in which you plan to deploy the solution, then you already have all the necessary permissions. If you don't have the `roles/owner` role, then ask your administrator to grant these permissions (or the roles that include these permissions) to you.\n| IAM permission required       | Predefined role that includes the required permissions  |\n|:--------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|\n| serviceusage.services.enable      | Service Usage Admin (roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin) |\n| iam.serviceAccounts.create      | Service Account Admin (roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin)  |\n| resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy    | Project IAM Admin (roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin) |\n| config.deployments.create config.deployments.list | Cloud Infrastructure Manager Admin (roles/config.admin) |\nWhen you initiate the deployment process, a [service account](/iam/docs/service-accounts) is created to deploy the solution on your behalf (and to delete the deployment later if you choose). This service account is assigned certain IAM permissions ; that is, the permissions are revoked automatically after the solution deployment and deletion operations are completed. Google recommends that after you delete the deployment, you delete the service account, as described later in this guide.### Choose a deployment method\nTo help you deploy this solution with minimal effort, a Terraform configuration is provided in GitHub. The Terraform configuration defines all the Google Cloud resources that are required for the solution.\nYou can deploy the solution by using one of the following methods:\n- **Through the console** : Use this method if you want to try the solution with the default configuration and see how it works. Cloud Build deploys all the resources that are required for the solution. When you no longer need the deployed solution, you can delete it through the console. Any resources that you create after you deploy the solution might need to be deleted separately.To use this deployment method, follow the instructions in [Deploy through the console](#deploy-from-console) .\n- **Using the Terraform CLI** : Use this method if you want to customize the solution or if you want to automate the provisioning and management of the resources by using the infrastructure as code (IaC) approach. Download the Terraform configuration from GitHub, optionally customize the code as necessary, and then deploy the solution by using the Terraform CLI. After you deploy the solution, you can continue to use Terraform to manage the solution.To use this deployment method, follow the instructions in [Deploy using the Terraform CLI](#deploy-using-terraform) .\n### Deploy through the console\nComplete the following steps to deploy the preconfigured solution.\n**Note:** If you want to customize the solution or automate the provisioning and management of the solution by using the infrastructure as code (IaC) approach, then see [Deploy using the Terraform CLI](#deploy-using-terraform) .\n- In the Google Cloud Jump Start Solutions catalog, go to the **Dynamic web application with Java** solution. [Go to the Dynamic web application with Java solution](https://console.cloud.google.com/products/solutions/details/dynamic-java-web-application) \n- Review the information that's provided on the page, such as the estimated cost of the solution and the estimated deployment time.\n- When you're ready to start deploying the solution, click **Deploy** .A step-by-step interactive guide is displayed.\n- Complete the steps in the interactive guide.Note the name that you enter for the deployment. This name is required later when you delete the deployment.When you click **Deploy** , the **Solution deployments** page is displayed. The **Status** field on this page shows **Deploying** .\n- Wait for the solution to be deployed.If the deployment fails, the **Status** field shows **Failed** . You can use the Cloud Build log to diagnose the errors. For more information, see [Errors when deploying through the console](#console-deploy-errors) .After the deployment is completed, the **Status** field changes to **Deployed** .\n- To view and use the deployed Point of Sale web app, follow the instructions in [Explore your deployed dynamic web application using Java](#explore-app) .\n- To view the Google Cloud resources that are deployed and their configuration, take an interactive tour. [Start the tour](https://console.cloud.google.com/products/solutions/deployments?walkthrough_id=deploy-java-webapp#step_index=1) \nWhen you no longer need the solution, you can delete it to avoid continued billing for the Google Cloud resources. For more information, see [Delete the solution deployment](#delete-deployment) .\n### Deploy using the Terraform CLI\nThis section describes how you can customize the solution or automate the provisioning and management of the solution by using the Terraform CLI. Solutions that you deploy by using the Terraform CLI are not displayed in the **Solution deployments** page in the Google Cloud console.\n**Note:** If you want to deploy the solution with the default configuration to see how it works, then follow the instructions in [Deploy through the console](#deploy-from-console) .\nYou can run Terraform either in Cloud Shell or on your local host. This guide describes how to run Terraform in Cloud Shell, which has Terraform preinstalled and configured to authenticate with Google Cloud.\nThe Terraform code for this solution is available in a GitHub repository.\n- Clone the GitHub repository to Cloud Shell. [](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-example-java-dynamic-point-of-sale) A prompt is displayed to confirm downloading the GitHub repository to Cloud Shell.\n- Click **Confirm** .Cloud Shell is launched in a separate browser tab, and the Terraform code is downloaded to the `$HOME/cloudshell_open` directory of your Cloud Shell environment.\n- In Cloud Shell, check whether the current working directory is `$HOME/cloudshell_open/terraform-example-java-dynamic-point-of-sale/infra` . This is the directory that contains the Terraform configuration files for the solution. If you need to change to that directory, run the following command:```\ncd $HOME/cloudshell_open/terraform-example-java-dynamic-point-of-sale/infra\n```\n- Initialize Terraform by running the following command:```\nterraform init\n```Wait until you see the following message:```\nTerraform has been successfully initialized!\n```The Terraform code that you downloaded includes variables that you can use to customize the deployment based on your requirements. For example, you can specify the Google Cloud project and the region where you want the solution to be deployed.\n- Make sure that the current working directory is `$HOME/cloudshell_open/terraform-example-java-dynamic-point-of-sale/infra` . If it isn't, go to that directory.\n- In the same directory, create a text file named `terraform.tfvars` .\n- In the `terraform.tfvars` file, copy the following code snippet, and set values for the required variables.- Follow the instructions that are provided as comments in the code snippet.\n- This code snippet includes only the variables for which youset values. The Terraform configuration includes other variables that have default values. To review all the variables and the default values, see the`variables.tf`file that's available in the`$HOME/cloudshell_open/terraform-example-java-dynamic-point-of-sale/infra`directory.\n- Make sure that each value that you set in the`terraform.tfvars`file matches the variable [type](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html#type-constraints) as declared in the`variables.tf`file. For example, if the type that\u2019s defined for a variable in the`variables.tf`file is`bool`, then you must specify`true`or`false`as the value of that variable in the`terraform.tfvars`file.\n```\n# This is an example of the terraform.tfvars file.# The values in this file must match the variable types declared in variables.tf.# The values in this file override any defaults in variables.tf.# ID of the project in which you want to deploy the solutionproject_id = \"PROJECT_ID\"\n```For information about the values that you can assign to the required variables, see the following:- : [Identifying projects](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) \n- Make sure that the current working directory is `$HOME/cloudshell_open/terraform-example-java-dynamic-point-of-sale/infra` . If it isn't, go to that directory.\n- Verify that the Terraform configuration has no errors:```\nterraform validate\n```If the command returns any errors, make the required corrections in the configuration and then run the `terraform validate` command again. Repeat this step until the command returns the following message:```\nSuccess! The configuration is valid.\n```\n- Review the resources that are defined in the configuration:```\nterraform plan\n```\n- If you didn't create the `terraform.tfvars` file as described earlier, Terraform prompts you to enter values for the variables that don't have default values. Enter the required values.The output of the `terraform plan` command is a list of the resources that Terraform provisions when you apply the configuration.If you want to make any changes, edit the configuration and then run the `terraform validate` and `terraform plan` commands again.When no further changes are necessary in the Terraform configuration, deploy the resources.\n- Make sure that the current working directory is `$HOME/cloudshell_open/terraform-example-java-dynamic-point-of-sale/infra` . If it isn't, go to that directory.\n- Apply the Terraform configuration:```\nterraform apply\n```\n- If you didn't create the `terraform.tfvars` file as described earlier, Terraform prompts you to enter values for the variables that don't have default values. Enter the required values.Terraform displays a list of the resources that will be created.\n- When you're prompted to perform the actions, enter `yes` .Terraform displays messages showing the progress of the deployment.If the deployment can't be completed, Terraform displays the errors that caused the failure. Review the error messages and update the configuration to fix the errors. Then run the `terraform apply` command again. For help with troubleshooting Terraform errors, see [Errors when deploying the solution using the Terraform CLI](#tf-deploy-errors) .After all the resources are created, Terraform displays the following message:```\nApply complete!\n```\n- To view and use the deployed Point of Sale web app, follow the instructions in [Explore your deployed dynamic web application using Java](#explore-app) .After the deployment is completed, the output is similar to the following:```\npos_application_url = \"http://34.27.130.180/\"\n```The `pos_application_url` is the IP address of your application frontend. GKE assigns this IP address to the public endpoint of the load balancer that exposes your application to the internet.\n- To view the Google Cloud resources that are deployed and their configuration, take an interactive tour. [Start the tour](https://console.cloud.google.com/products/solutions/deployments?walkthrough_id=deploy-java-webapp#step_index=1) \nWhen you no longer need the solution, you can delete it to avoid continued billing for the Google Cloud resources. For more information, see [Delete the solution deployment](#delete-deployment) .\n## Explore your deployed dynamic web app\nYou have now deployed the Point of Sale dynamic web app! Visit the Point of Sale website and look around, and then explore how the solution works in Google Cloud console. Be aware that it can take a few minutes after deploying the application for the site to show up at the provided address.\n### What is the Point of Sale web app?\nThis Jump Start Solution uses a sample dynamic web app named Point of Sale to demonstrate how Google Cloud GKE infrastructure can help Java developers build, deploy, and manage web apps with static assets and dynamic content. Point of Sale is a web app that mimics a real-world checkout terminal for a retail store.\nThe application frontend is used by a sales representative to check out items for a customer at a retail store. On this screen, the sales representative can perform the following actions:\n- Add items to their cart and proceed to pay.\n- Clear the cart or remove items from the cart.\n- See a payment receipt. When the user pays, the web app displays a bill with the result of the transaction.Other edge cases are also covered. For example, if the user attempts to pay with no elements in the cart, the web app displays an error message.\nTo view the Google Cloud resources that are deployed and their configuration, take an interactive tour.\n[Start the tour](https://console.cloud.google.com/products/solutions/deployments?walkthrough_id=deploy-java-webapp#step_index=1)\nTo launch the deployed Point of Sale web app frontend:\n- Go to the **Services** page in the Google Cloud console. [Go to Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/discovery) \n- Click the IP address of the **Endpoints** for the `api-server-lb` external load balancer. The frontend of your Point of Sale web app opens in a new browser window.\nYou can now interact with the Point of Sale web app just as its users would see it, including adding products, paying, or seeing the bill.\n### Generate load to the web app\nTo examine how GKE responds to normal increases in traffic on your web app, send traced requests to the web application. The following steps use [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) to automatically send several requests. `hey` comes pre-installed on the Cloud Shell:\n- In Cloud Shell, make sure that the current working directory is `$HOME/cloudshell_open/terraform-example-java-dynamic-point-of-sale/infra` . If it isn't, go to that directory.\n- Send 150 requests to the web application:```\nexport LB_IP_ADDRESS=$(gcloud compute addresses list --filter=name:jss-pos-1 --format='value(address)')hey -n 150 \\\u00a0-m POST \\\u00a0-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\u00a0-d '{\"paidAmount\":14.59865,\"type\":\"CASH\",\"items\":[{\"itemId\":\"19a89a67-3958-46cf-9776-c29983871c93\",\"itemCount\":1},{\"itemId\":\"729d0dd6-950e-4098-8f70-e7144076e899\",\"itemCount\":1}]}' \\\u00a0 http://$LB_IP_ADDRESS/api/pay\n```The script assigns the IP address of the [frontend of the dynamic web app](#explore-frontend) to the `LB_IP_ADDRESS` variable.The output is the similar to the following:```\nSummary:\u00a0 Total: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a08.7963 secs\u00a0 Slowest: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a06.0000 secs\u00a0 Fastest: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.7981 secs\u00a0 Average: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02.7593 secs\u00a0 Requests/sec: 17.0527\u00a0 Total data: \u00a0 132600 bytes\u00a0 Size/request: 884 bytesResponse time histogram:\u00a0 0.798 [1] \u00a0 \u00a0 |\u25a0\u00a0 1.318 [24] \u00a0 \u00a0|\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u00a0 1.838 [42] \u00a0 \u00a0|\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u00a0 2.359 [26] \u00a0 \u00a0|\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u00a0 2.879 [7] \u00a0 \u00a0 |\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u00a0 3.399 [0] \u00a0 \u00a0 |\u00a0 3.919 [7] \u00a0 \u00a0 |\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u00a0 4.439 [11] \u00a0 \u00a0|\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u00a0 4.960 [6] \u00a0 \u00a0 |\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u00a0 5.480 [9] \u00a0 \u00a0 |\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u00a0 6.000 [17] \u00a0 \u00a0|\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0Latency distribution:\u00a0 10% in 1.1932 secs\u00a0 25% in 1.5938 secs\u00a0 50% in 1.9906 secs\u00a0 75% in 4.3013 secs\u00a0 90% in 5.5936 secs\u00a0 95% in 5.8922 secs\u00a0 99% in 6.0000 secsDetails (average, fastest, slowest):\u00a0 DNS+dialup: \u00a0 0.0016 secs, 0.7981 secs, 6.0000 secs\u00a0 DNS-lookup: \u00a0 0.0000 secs, 0.0000 secs, 0.0000 secs\u00a0 req write: \u00a0 \u00a00.0004 secs, 0.0000 secs, 0.0036 secs\u00a0 resp wait: \u00a0 \u00a02.7565 secs, 0.7980 secs, 5.9930 secs\u00a0 resp read: \u00a0 \u00a00.0001 secs, 0.0000 secs, 0.0002 secsStatus code distribution:\u00a0 [200] 150 responses\n```The `Status code distribution` field shows the 150 responses confirmation.

After all the resources are deleted, Terraform displays the following message:```\nDestroy complete!\n```If the deletion fails, see the troubleshooting guidance in [Error when deleting a deployment](#error-deleting-deployment) .\nWhen you no longer need the Google Cloud project that you used for the solution, you can delete the project. For more information, see [Optional: Delete the project](#delete-project) .\n### Optional: Delete the project\nIf you deployed the solution in a new Google Cloud project, and if you no longer need the project, then delete it by completing the following steps:\n**Caution:** If you delete a project, all the resources in the project are permanently deleted.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page. [Go to Manage resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects) \n- In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then  click **Delete** .\n- At the prompt, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** .\nIf you decide to retain the project, then delete the service account that was created for this solution, as described in the next section.\n### Optional: Delete the service account\nIf you deleted the project that you used for the solution, then skip this section.\nAs mentioned earlier in this guide, when you deployed the solution, a service account was created on your behalf. The service account was assigned certain IAM permissions ; that is, the permissions were revoked automatically after the solution deployment and deletion operations were completed, but the service account isn't deleted. Google recommends that you delete this service account.\n- If you deployed the solution through the Google Cloud console, go to the [Solution deployments](https://console.cloud.google.com/products/solutions/deployments) page. (If you're already on that page, refresh the browser.) A process is triggered in the background to delete the service account. No further action is necessary.\n- If you deployed the solution by using the Terraform CLI, complete the following steps:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Service accounts** page. [Go to Service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) \n- Select the project that you used for the solution.\n- Select the service account that you want to delete.The email ID of the service account that was created for the solution is in the following format:```\ngoog-sc-DEPLOYMENT_NAME-NNN@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n```The email ID contains the following values:- : the name of the deployment.\n- : a random 3-digit number.\n- : the ID of the project in which you deployed the solution.\n- Click **Delete** .\n## Troubleshoot errors\nThe actions that you can take to diagnose and resolve errors depend on the deployment method and the complexity of the error.\n### Errors when deploying through the console\nIf the deployment fails when you use the console, do the following:\n- Go to the **Solution deployments** page.If the deployment failed, the **Status** field shows **Failed** .\n- View the details of the errors that caused the failure:- Click more_vert **Actions** .\n- Select **View Cloud Build logs** .\n- Review the Cloud Build log and take appropriate action to resolve the issue that caused the failure.\n### Errors when deploying using the Terraform CLI\nIf the deployment fails when you use Terraform, the output of the `terraform apply` command includes error messages that you can review to diagnose the problem.\nThe examples in the following sections show deployment errors that you might encounter when you use Terraform.\nIf you create a project and then immediately attempt to deploy the solution in the new project, the deployment might fail with an error like the following:\n```\nError: Error creating Network: googleapi: Error 403: Compute Engine API has not\nbeen used in project PROJECT_ID before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting\nhttps://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/compute.googleapis.com/overview?project=PROJECT_ID\nthen retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action\nto propagate to our systems and retry.\n```\nIf this error occurs, wait a few minutes and then run the `terraform apply` command again.\nWhen you run the `terraform apply` command, a `cannot assign requested address` error might occur, with a message like the following:\n```\nError: Error creating service account:\n Post \"https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts:\n dial tcp [2001:db8:ffff:ffff::5f]:443:\n connect: cannot assign requested address\n```\nIf this error occurs, run the `terraform apply` command again.\n### Error when deleting a deployment\nIn certain cases, attempts to delete a deployment might fail:\n- After deploying a solution through the console, if you change any resource that was provisioned by the solution, and if you then try to delete the deployment, the deletion might fail. The **Status** field on the **Solution deployments** page shows **Failed** , and the Cloud Build log shows the cause of the error.\n- After deploying a solution by using the Terraform CLI, if you change any resource by using a non-Terraform interface (for example, the console), and if you then try to delete the deployment, the deletion might fail. The messages in the output of the`terraform destroy`command show the cause of the error.\nReview the error logs and messages, identify and delete the resources that caused the error, and then try deleting the deployment again.\nIf a console-based deployment doesn't get deleted and if you can't diagnose the error by using the Cloud Build log, then you can delete the deployment by using the Terraform CLI, as described in the next section.\n### Delete a console-based deployment by using the Terraform CLI\nThis section describes how to delete a console-based deployment if errors occur when you try to delete it through the console. In this approach, you download the Terraform configuration for the deployment that you want to delete and then use the Terraform CLI to delete the deployment.\n- Identify the region where the deployment's Terraform code, logs, and other data are stored. This region might be different from the region that you selected while deploying the solution.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Solution deployments** page. [Go to Solution deployments](https://console.cloud.google.com/products/solutions/deployments) \n- Select the project that contains the deployment that you want to delete.\n- In the list of deployments, identify the row for the deployment that you want to delete.\n- Click expand_more **View all rowcontent** .\n- In the **Location** column, note the location, as highlighted in the following example: \n- In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell. [Activate Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true) At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works) session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment  with the Google Cloud CLI  already installed and with values already set for  your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.\n- Create environment variables for the project ID, region, and name of the deployment that you want to delete:```\nexport REGION=\"REGION\"export PROJECT_ID=\"PROJECT_ID\"export DEPLOYMENT_NAME=\"DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"\n```In these commands, replace the following:- : the location that you noted earlier in this procedure.\n- : the ID of the project where you deployed the solution.\n- : the name of the deployment that you want to delete.\n- Get the ID of the latest revision of the deployment that you want to delete:```\nexport REVISION_ID=$(curl \\\u00a0 \u00a0 -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \"https://config.googleapis.com/v1alpha2/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${REGION}/deployments/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 | jq .latestRevision -r)\u00a0 \u00a0 echo $REVISION_ID\n```The output is similar to the following:```\nprojects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_NAME/revisions/r-0\n```\n- Get the Cloud Storage location of the Terraform configuration for the deployment:```\nexport CONTENT_PATH=$(curl \\\u00a0 \u00a0 -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \"https://config.googleapis.com/v1alpha2/${REVISION_ID}\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 | jq .applyResults.content -r)\u00a0 \u00a0 echo $CONTENT_PATH\n```The following is an example of the output of this command:```\ngs://PROJECT_ID-REGION-blueprint-config/DEPLOYMENT_NAME/r-0/apply_results/content\n```\n- Download the Terraform configuration from Cloud Storage to Cloud Shell:```\ngsutil cp -r $CONTENT_PATH $HOMEcd $HOME/content/infra\n```Wait until the `Operation completed` message is displayed, as shown in the following example:```\nOperation completed over 45 objects/268.5 KiB\n```\n- Initialize Terraform:```\nterraform init\n```Wait until you see the following message:```\nTerraform has been successfully initialized!\n```\n- Remove the deployed resources:```\nterraform destroy\n```Terraform displays a list of the resources that will be destroyed.If any warnings about undeclared variables are displayed, ignore the warnings.\n- When you're prompted to perform the actions, enter `yes` .Terraform displays messages showing the progress. After all the resources are deleted, Terraform displays the following message:```\nDestroy complete!\n```\n- Delete the deployment artifact:```\ncurl -X DELETE \\\u00a0 \u00a0 -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \"https://config.googleapis.com/v1alpha2/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${REGION}/deployments/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}?force=true&delete_policy=abandon\"\n```\n- Wait a few seconds and then verify that the deployment artifact was deleted:```\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \"https://config.googleapis.com/v1alpha2/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${REGION}/deployments/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}\" \\\u00a0 \u00a0 | jq .error.message\n```If the output shows `null` , wait a few seconds and then run the command again.After the deployment artifact is deleted, a message as shown in the following example is displayed:```\nResource 'projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_NAME' was not found\n```\n### Submit feedback\nJump Start Solutions are for informational purposes only and are not officially supported products.
