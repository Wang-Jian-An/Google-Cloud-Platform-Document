Moving apps from one environment to another is a challenging task, even for experienced teams, so you need to plan and execute your migration carefully.\nThis document is part of the following multi-part series about migrating to Google Cloud:\n- Migrate to Google Cloud: Get started (this document)\n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Assess and discover your workloads](/architecture/migration-to-gcp-assessing-and-discovering-your-workloads) \n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Build your foundation](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-building-your-foundation) \n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Transfer your large datasets](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-transferring-your-large-datasets) \n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Deploy your workloads](/architecture/migration-to-gcp-deploying-your-workloads) \n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Migrate from manual deployments to automated, containerized deployments](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-automated-containerized-deployments) \n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Optimize your environment](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-optimizing-your-environment) \n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Best practices for validating a migration plan](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-best-practices) \n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Minimize costs](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-minimize-costs) \nThis document is useful if you're planning a migration from an on-premises environment, from a private hosting environment, from another cloud provider to Google Cloud, or if you're evaluating the opportunity to migrate and want to explore what it might look like.\n", "content": "## Beginning the journey\nWhen planning your migration to Google Cloud, you start by defining the environments that are involved in the migration. Your starting point can be an on-premises environment, a private hosting environment, or another public cloud environment.\nAn on-premises environment is an environment where you have full ownership and responsibility. You retain full control over every aspect of the environment, such as cooling, physical security, and hardware maintenance.\nIn a private hosting environment such as a [colocation facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colocation_centre) , you outsource part of the physical infrastructure and its management to an external party. This infrastructure is typically shared between customers. In a private hosting environment, you don't have to manage the physical security and safety services. Some hosting environments let you manage part of the physical hardware, such as servers, racks, and network devices, while others manage that hardware for you. Typically, power and network cabling are provided as a service so you don't have to manage them. You maintain full control over hypervisors that virtualize physical resources, the virtualized infrastructure that you provision, and workloads that you run on that infrastructure.\nA [public cloud environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Public_cloud) has the advantage that you don't have to manage the whole resource stack by yourself. You can focus on the aspect of the stack that is most valuable to you. Like in a private hosting environment, you don't have to manage the underlying physical infrastructure. Additionally, you don't have to manage the resource virtualization hypervisor. You can build a virtualized infrastructure and can deploy your workloads in this new infrastructure. You can also buy fully managed services, where you care only about your workloads, handing off the operational burden of managing runtime environments.\nFor each environment, this document evaluates the following aspects as well as who should provide and manage the relevant services:\n| Resources     | On-premises environment | Private hosting environment | Public cloud environment       |\n|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|\n| Physical security and safety | You      | Service provider    | Service provider         |\n| Power and network cabling | You      | Service provider    | Service provider         |\n| Hardware (incl. maintenance) | You      | Depends on service provider | Service provider         |\n| Virtualization platform  | You      | You       | Service provider         |\n| App resources    | You      | You       | You (eventually leveraging fully managed services) |\nIn this document, the target environment is Google Cloud.\nAfter you define your starting and target environments, you define the workload types and the related operational processes that are in scope for the migration. This document considers two types of workloads and operations: legacy and cloud-optimized.\nLegacy workloads and operations are developed without any consideration for cloud environments. These workloads and operations can be difficult to modify and expensive to run and maintain because they usually don't support any type of scalability.\nCloud-optimized workloads and operations are natively scalable, portable, available, and secure. The workloads and operations can help increase developer productivity and agility, because developers can focus on the actual workloads, rather than spending effort to manage development and runtime environments, or dealing with manual and cumbersome deployment processes. Google Cloud also has a [shared responsibility model for security](/security/overview) . Google Cloud is responsible for the physical security and the security of the infrastructure, while you're responsible for the security of the workloads you deploy to the infrastructure.\nConsidering these environment and workload types, your starting situation is one of the following:\n- On-premises or private hosting environment with legacy workloads and operations.\n- On-premises or private hosting environment with cloud-optimized workloads and operations.\n- Public cloud or private hosting environment with legacy workloads and operations.\n- Public cloud or private hosting environment with cloud-optimized workloads and operations.\nThe migration process depends on your starting point.\nMigrating a workload from a legacy on-premises environment or private hosting environment to a cloud-optimized environment, such as a public cloud, can be challenging and risky. Successful migrations change the workload to migrate as little as possible during the migration operations. Moving legacy on-premises apps to the cloud often requires multiple migration steps.\n## Types of migrations\nThis document defines the following major types of migrations:\n- Rehost: lift and shift\n- Replatform: lift and optimize\n- Refactor: move and improve\n- Re-architect: continue to modernize\n- Rebuild: remove and replace, sometimes called\n- Repurchase\nIn the following sections, each type of migration is defined with examples of when to use each type.\n### Rehost: lift and shift\nIn a rehost migration, you move workloads from a source environment to a target environment with minor or no modifications or refactoring. The modifications you apply to the workloads to migrate are only the minimum changes you need to make in order for the workloads to operate in the target environment.\nA rehost migration is ideal when a workload can operate as-is in the target environment, or when there is little or no business need for change. This migration is the type that requires the least amount of time because the amount of refactoring is kept to a minimum.\nThere might be technical issues that force a rehost migration. If you cannot refactor a workload to migrate and cannot decommission the workload, you must use a rehost migration. For example, it can be difficult or impossible to modify the source code of the workload, or the build process isn't straightforward so producing new artifacts after refactoring the source code might not be possible.\nRehost migrations are the easiest to perform because your team can continue to use the same set of tools and skills that they were using before. These migrations also support ready-made software. Because you migrate existing workloads with minimal refactoring, rehost migrations tend to be the quickest, compared to refactor or rebuild migrations.\nHowever, after a rehost migration, the workloads that are running in the target environment aren't optimized for the cloud. These workloads don't take full advantage of cloud platform features, such as horizontal scalability, fine-grained pricing, and highly managed services.\n### Replatform: lift and optimize\nIn a replatform migration, you lift the existing workloads and then optimize them for the new cloud environment.\nA replatform migration is best for organizations that want to take advantage of all the core competencies of the cloud. These competencies include elastic computing, redundancy, improved performance, and security.\nFor example, you might replatform a workload to the cloud in order to take advantage of a cloud-based microservice architecture or containers in Google Kubernetes Engine. These workloads will then have higher performance and more efficiency running in the cloud.\nHowever, replatform migrations take more work to accomplish than rehost migrations. The new cloud platform will have a different underlying codebase, which requires several rounds of testing to make sure that everything is running at its optimal level.\n### Refactor: move and improve\nIn a refactor migration, you modify the workloads to take advantage of cloud capabilities, and not just modify the workloads to make them work in the new environment. You can improve each workload for performance, features, cost, and user experience.\nYou can modify the workloads while you're migrating them to the cloud, or even before migrating them. For example, if you don't have substantial experience with cloud migrations, you might prefer to modify the workloads while you're migrating. However, if you have cloud migration experience, you may already have an idea of the modifications that the workloads need to take full advantage of cloud capabilities.\nIf the current architecture or infrastructure of an app isn't supported in the target environment as it is, a certain amount of refactoring is necessary to overcome these limits.\nAnother reason to choose the refactor approach is when a major update to the workload is necessary in addition to the updates you need to make to migrate.\nRefactor migrations let your app take advantage of features of a cloud platform, such as scalability and high availability. You can also architect the improvement to increase the portability of the app.\nHowever, refactor migrations take longer than rehost migrations because the workloads must be refactored in order for the app to migrate.\nA refactor migration also requires that you learn new skills.\n### Re-architect: continue to modernize\nRe-architect migrations are similar to refactor migrations. However, instead of restructuring how the workload code works, re-architect migrations change how that code functions. Those code changes optimize the workload and take advantage of cloud-optimized properties such as scalability, security, and agility. For example, a re-architect migration can take one large, monolithic workload and turn it into several independent microservices that you deploy on Google Cloud.\nA re-architect migration is more complex than a refactor migration, so it takes more time and effort. A re-architect migration can also potentially introduce bugs or security issues into the new workloads. Thus, a re-architect migration requires several rounds of testing to make sure that everything is running at its optimal level.\n### Rebuild: remove and replace\nIn a rebuild migration, you decommission an existing app and completely redesign and rewrite it as a fully cloud-optimized app.\nIf the current app isn't meeting your goals\u2014for example, you don't want to maintain it, it's too costly to migrate using one of the previously mentioned approaches, or it's not supported on Google Cloud\u2014you can do a rebuild migration.\nRebuild migrations let your app take full advantage of Google Cloud features, such as horizontal scalability, highly managed services, and high availability. Because you're rewriting the app from scratch, you also remove the technical debt of the existing, legacy version.\nHowever, rebuild migrations can take longer than rehost or refactor migrations. Moreover, this type of migration isn't suitable for ready-made apps because it requires rewriting the app. You need to evaluate the extra time and effort to redesign and rewrite the app as part of its lifecycle.\nA rebuild migration also requires new skills. You need to use new toolchains to provision and configure the new environment and to deploy the app in that environment.\n### Repurchase\nA repurchase migration is when you move from a purchased on-premises workload to a cloud-hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) equivalent. For example, you can move from on-premises collaboration software and local storage to Google Workspace.\nFrom a resources perspective, a repurchase migration might be a lot easier than refactoring, rebuilding, or re-architecting. However, a repurchase migration might be a lot more expensive and you might not get the granular features of controlling your own cloud environments.\n## Google Cloud Adoption Framework\nBefore starting your migration, you should evaluate the maturity of your organization in adopting cloud technologies. The [Google Cloud Adoption Framework](/adoption-framework) serves both as a map for determining where your business information technology capabilities are now, and as a guide to where you want to be.\nYou can use this framework to assess your organization's readiness for Google Cloud and what you need to do to fill in the gaps and develop new competencies, as illustrated in the following diagram.\nThe framework assesses four themes:\n- **Learn.** The quality and scale of your learning programs.\n- **Lead.** The extent to which your IT departments are supported by a mandate from leadership to migrate to Google Cloud.\n- **Scale.** The extent to which you use cloud-optimized services, and how much operational automation you have in place.\n- **Secure.** The capability to protect your current environment from unauthorized and inappropriate access.\nFor each theme, you should be in one of the following three phases, according to the framework:\n- **Tactical.** There are no coherent plans covering all the individual workloads you have in place. You're mostly interested in a quick return on investments and little disruption to your IT organization.\n- **Strategic.** There is a plan in place to develop individual workloads with an eye to future scaling needs. You're interested in the mid-term goal to streamline operations to be more efficient than they are today.\n- **Transformational.** Cloud operations work smoothly, and you use data that you gather from those operations to improve your IT business. You're interested in the long-term goal of making the IT department one of the engines of innovation in your organization.\nWhen you evaluate the four topics in terms of the three phases, you get the Cloud Maturity Scale. In each theme, you can see what happens when you move from adopting new technologies when needed, to working with them more strategically across the organization\u2014which naturally means deeper, more comprehensive, and more consistent training for your teams.\n## The migration path\nIt's important to remember that a migration is a journey. You are at point A with your existing infrastructure and environments, and you want to reach point B. To get from A to B, you can choose any of the options previously described.\nThe following diagram illustrates the path of this journey.\nThere are four phases of your migration:\n- **Assess.** In this phase, you perform a thorough assessment and discovery of your existing environment in order to understand your app and environment inventory, identify app dependencies and requirements, perform total cost of ownership calculations, and establish app performance benchmarks. For more information about the assess phase, see [Migrate to Google Cloud: Assess and discover your workloads](/architecture/migration-to-gcp-assessing-and-discovering-your-workloads) , [Migrate to Google Cloud: Best practices](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-best-practices) , and [Migration Center: Start an asset discovery](/migration-center/docs/start-asset-discovery) .\n- **Plan.** In this phase, you create the basic cloud infrastructure for your workloads to live in and plan how you will move apps. This planning includes identity management, organization and project structure, networking, sorting your apps, and developing a prioritized migration strategy. For more information about planning and building your foundation, see [Migrate to Google Cloud: Build your foundation](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-building-your-foundation) .\n- **Deploy.** In this phase, you design, implement and execute a deployment process to move workloads to Google Cloud. You might also have to refine your cloud infrastructure to deal with new needs.
