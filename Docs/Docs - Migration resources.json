These resources are designed to help you complete these kinds of migrations:\n- From an on-premises environment\n- From a private hosting environment\n- From another cloud provider\n- Across Google Cloud regions\nA migration journey isn't unique to Google Cloud. Moving from one environment to another is a challenging task, so you need to plan and execute your migration carefully. No matter what you're migrating\u2014whether apps, VMs, or containers\u2014you need to complete tasks such as creating an inventory, establishing user and service identities, deploying your workloads, and optimizing for performance and scalability.\nAs part of your migration journey, you have to make decisions that are dependent on the environment, the workloads, and the infrastructure that you're migrating to Google Cloud or to a hybrid cloud environment. The [Migrate to Google Cloud](/architecture/migration-to-gcp-getting-started) series helps you choose the best path to suit your migration needs by establishing a migration framework. It's important to establish a migration framework because migration can be a repeatable task. For example, if you initially migrate your VMs to Google Cloud, you might also consider moving other data and workloads to Google Cloud. Establishing a general framework that can be applied to different workloads can make future migrations easier for you.\n", "content": "## Migration resources in the Architecture Center\nYou can filter the following list of migration resources by typing a product name or a phrase that's in the resource title or description.", "guide": "Docs"}
