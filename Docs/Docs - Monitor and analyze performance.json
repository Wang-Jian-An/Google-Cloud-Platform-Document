Cloud Logging can collect logs from the services of Google Cloud and other cloud providers.\n## Analyze code performance\nCode that performs poorly can increase the latency of your applications and the cost of running them. [Cloud Profiler](/profiler/docs) helps you identify and address performance issues by continuously analyzing the performance of CPU-intensive or memory-intensive functions that an application uses.\n## Collect latency data\nIn complex application stacks and microservices-based architectures, assessing [latency](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)) in inter-service communication and identifying performance bottlenecks can be difficult. [Cloud Trace](/trace/docs) and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) tools help you collect latency data from your deployments at scale. These tools also help you analyze the latency data efficiently.\n## Monitor network performance\nThe [Performance Dashboard](/network-intelligence-center/docs/performance-dashboard/concepts/overview) of the Network Intelligence Center gives you a comprehensive view of performance metrics for the Google network and the resources in your project. These metrics can help you determine the cause of network-related performance issues. For example, you can identify whether a performance issue is the result of a [problem in your project or the Google network](/network-intelligence-center/docs/performance-dashboard/concepts/use-cases-project#current-diagnostics) .\n## What's next\n- Learn about the [best practices for monitoring your cloud resources](/architecture/framework/operational-excellence/set-up-monitoring-alerting-logging) .\n- Review the best practices for optimizing the performance of your Google Cloud resources:- [Optimize compute performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/compute) .\n- [Optimize storage performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/storage) .\n- [Optimize networking performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/networking) .\n- [Optimize database performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/databases) .\n- [Optimize analytics performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/analytics) .", "guide": "Docs"}
