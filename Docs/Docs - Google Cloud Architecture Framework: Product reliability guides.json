The guides also provide recommendations for minimizing and recovering from failures and for scaling your applications well under load.\n**Note:** To learn about the platform-level building blocks of reliability in Google Cloud (zones, regions, and location-scoped resources) and the availability levels that they provide, see [Google Cloud infrastructure reliability guide](/architecture/infra-reliability-guide) . This guide also provides guidelines for assessing the reliability requirements of your workloads, and presents architectural recommendations for building and managing reliable infrastructure in Google Cloud.\nThe product reliability guides are organized under the following areas:\n- Compute- [Compute Engine](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/compute) \n- [Cloud Run](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/run) \n- [Cloud Functions ](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/functions) \n- [Google Kubernetes Engine ](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/kubernetes-engine) \n- Storage and databases- [Cloud Storage](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/storage) \n- [Firestore](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/firestore) \n- [Bigtable](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/bigtable) \n- [Cloud SQL](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/sql) \n- [Spanner](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/spanner) \n- [Filestore](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/filestore) \n- [Memorystore](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/memorystore) \n- Networking- [Cloud DNS](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/dns) \n- [Cloud Load Balancing](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/load-balancing) \n- [Cloud CDN](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/cdn) \n- Data analytics- [BigQuery](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/bigquery) \n- [Dataflow](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/dataflow) \n- [Dataproc](/architecture/framework/reliability/product-guides/dataproc", "content": ")", "guide": "Docs"}
