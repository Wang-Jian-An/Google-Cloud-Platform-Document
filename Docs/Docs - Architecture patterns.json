The following networking patterns can help you to meet communication and security requirements for your applications:\n- [Mirrored pattern](/architecture/hybrid-multicloud-secure-networking-patterns/mirrored-pattern) \n- [Meshed pattern](/architecture/hybrid-multicloud-secure-networking-patterns/meshed-pattern) \n- [Gated patterns](/architecture/hybrid-multicloud-secure-networking-patterns/gated-patterns) - [Gated egress](/architecture/hybrid-multicloud-secure-networking-patterns/gated-egress) \n- [Gated ingress](/architecture/hybrid-multicloud-secure-networking-patterns/gated-ingress) \n- [Gated egress and gated ingress](/architecture/hybrid-multicloud-secure-networking-patterns/gated-egress-ingress) \n- [Handover pattern](/architecture/hybrid-multicloud-secure-networking-patterns/handover-pattern", "content": ")", "guide": "Docs"}
