This document discusses how to design, implement, and validate a plan to migrate from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage. The document describes a portion of the overall migration process in which you create an inventory of Amazon S3 artifacts and create a plan for how to handle the migration process.\nThe discussion in this document is intended for cloud administrators who want details about how to plan and implement a migration process. It's also intended for decision-makers who are evaluating the opportunity to migrate and who want to explore what migration might look like.\nThis document is part of a multi-part series about migrating from AWS to Google Cloud that includes the following documents:\n- [Get started](/architecture/migration-from-aws-get-started) \n- [Migrate from Amazon EC2 to Compute Engine](/architecture/migrate-amazon-ec2-to-compute-engine) \n- Migrate from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage (this document)\n- [Migrate from Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) to Google Kubernetes Engine](/architecture/migrate-amazon-eks-to-gke) \nThis series assumes that you've read and are familiar with the following documents:\n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Choose your migration path](/architecture/migration) : introduces the Migration to Google Cloud series and helps you understand how each piece of the series relates to other documents.\n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Get started](/solutions/migration-to-gcp-getting-started) : describes the general migration framework that you follow in this migration.\n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Transfer your large datasets](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-transferring-your-large-datasets) : describes how to transfer data to Google Cloud.\n- [Migrate to Google Cloud: Best practices for validating a migration plan](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-best-practices) : describes potential changes and improvements to your migration plan.\nThe following diagram illustrates the phases of your migration journey. For migration scenarios, the Deploy phase is equivalent to performing a migration process.\nYou might migrate from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage in a series of iterations\u2014for example, you might migrate some data and workloads first and others later. For each separate migration iteration, you follow the phases of the general migration framework:\n- Assess and discover your workloads and data.\n- Plan and build a foundation on Google Cloud.\n- Migrate your workloads and data to Google Cloud.\n- Optimize your Google Cloud environment.\nFor more information about the phases of this framework, see [Migrate to Google Cloud: Get started](/solutions/migration-to-gcp-getting-started) .\n", "content": "## Assess the source environment\nIn the assessment phase, you determine the requirements and dependencies of the resources that you want to migrate from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage.\nThe assessment phase consists of the following tasks:\n- Build a comprehensive inventory of your workloads and data.\n- Catalog your workloads and data according to their properties and dependencies.\n- Train and educate your teams about Google Cloud.\n- Build experiments and proofs of concept on Google Cloud.\n- Calculate the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the target environment.\n- Decide on the order and priority of the workloads that you want to migrate.\nFor more information about the assessment phase and about these tasks, see [Migrate to Google Cloud: Assess and discover your workloads](/solutions/migration-to-gcp-assessing-and-discovering-your-workloads) . The following sections are based on information in that document.\n### Build an inventory of your Amazon S3 buckets\nTo scope your migration, you create two inventories: an inventory of your Amazon S3 buckets, and an inventory of the objects that are stored in the buckets.\nTo build the inventory of your Amazon S3 buckets, we recommend that you use [StratoZone](/migrate/stratozone/docs/about-stratozone) . StratoZone lets you import data from Amazon S3 and other AWS resources by running an [open source data-collection script](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/aws-to-stratozone-export) . StratoZone then recommends relevant Google Cloud services that you can migrate to.\nWhen you run the AWS data-collection script, consider the following:\n- Assess the data-collection script's codebase to evaluate what data the script collects.\n- Run the data-collection script by using an instance of [AWS CloudShell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/) . Using the shell avoids the need to generate, distribute, and maintain authentication keys to run the data-collection script in other runtime environments.\n- Run the data-collection script by impersonating an account that has minimal, read-only permissions. Using read-only permissions avoids any accidental modifications to your AWS resources.\n- If appropriate, anonymize personally identifiable information (PII) from the reports that the data-collection script generates.\nFor more information about assessing your AWS environment by using StratoZone, see [Import data from other cloud providers](/migrate/stratozone/docs/import-data-scripts) .\nAfter you build the inventory of your Amazon S3 buckets, refine the inventory by considering the following data points about each Amazon S3 bucket:\n- How you've configured Amazon S3 bucket server-side encryption.\n- Your settings for Amazon S3 bucket identity and access management.\n- The configuration for S3 Block Public Access.\n- Any cost allocation tags for Amazon S3 buckets.\n- The configuration for S3 Object Lock.\n- How you're accessing the Amazon S3 bucket.\n- How you've configured Requester Pays.\n- The settings for Amazon S3 object versioning.\n- The configuration for AWS Backup policies for Amazon S3.\n- Whether you're using Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering.\n- How you've configured for Amazon S3 object replication.\n- The Amazon S3 object lifecycle.\nWe also recommend that you gather data about your Amazon S3 buckets that lets you compute aggregate statistics about the objects that each bucket contains. For example, if you gather the total object size, average object size, and object count, it can help you [estimate the time and cost that's needed](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-transferring-your-large-datasets#step_3_evaluating_your_transfer_options) to migrate from an Amazon S3 bucket to a Cloud Storage bucket.\nTo gather these data points about your Amazon S3 buckets, you can implement data-collection mechanisms and processes that rely on AWS tools, such as the following:\n- Amazon S3 monitoring tools\n- S3 Analytics\n- AWS APIs\n- AWS developer tools\n- The AWS command-line interface\nTo help you avoid issues during the migration, and to help estimate the effort needed for the migration, we recommend that you evaluate how Amazon S3 bucket features map to similar Cloud Storage bucket features. The following table summarizes this mapping.\n| Amazon S3 feature       | Cloud Storage feature            |\n|:------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bucket naming rules      | Bucket name requirements            |\n| Bucket location       | Bucket location              |\n| Server-side encryption     | Encryption options             |\n| Identity and access management   | Identity and Access Management (IAM)         |\n| Public access        | Public data access Public access prevention       |\n| Cost allocation S3 bucket tags   | Tags and labels              |\n| S3 Object Lock       | Retention policies and retention policy lock       |\n| Methods for accessing an Amazon S3 bucket | Uploads and downloads            |\n| Requester Pays       | Requester Pays              |\n| Object versioning       | Object versioning             |\n| AWS Backup policies for Amazon S3   | Event-driven transfer jobs           |\n| Intelligent-Tiering      | Autoclass               |\n| Object replication      | Dual-region replication Turbo replication Event-driven transfer jobs |\n| Object lifecycle       | Object Lifecycle Management           |\nAs noted earlier, the features listed in the preceding table might look similar when you compare them. However, differences in the design and implementation of the features in the two cloud providers can have significant effects on your migration from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage.\n### Build an inventory of the objects stored in your Amazon S3 objects\nAfter you build the inventory of your Amazon S3 buckets, we recommend that you build an inventory of the objects stored in these buckets by using the [Amazon S3 inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide//storage-inventory.html) tool.\nTo build the inventory of your Amazon S3 objects, consider the following for each object:\n- Amazon S3 object name\n- Amazon S3 object size\n- Amazon S3 object metadata\n- Amazon S3 object subresources\n- Amazon S3 object versions, and if you need to migrate these versions\n- Amazon S3 object presigned URLs\n- Amazon S3 object transformations\n- Amazon S3 object tags\n- Amazon S3 object storage classes\n- Amazon S3 object archiving\nWe also recommend that you gather data about your Amazon S3 objects to understand how often you and your workloads create, update, and delete Amazon S3 objects.\nTo help you avoid issues during the migration, and to help estimate the effort needed for the migration, we recommend that you evaluate how Amazon S3 object features map to similar Cloud Storage object features. The following table summarizes this mapping.\n| Amazon S3 feature      | Cloud Storage feature            |\n|:----------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Object naming rules      | Object name requirements           |\n| Object metadata Object tags    | Object metadata             |\n| Object subresources      | Object metadata             |\n| Object presigned URLs     | Signed URLs              |\n| Object transformations     | Pub/Sub notifications for Cloud Storage Cloud Functions Cloud Run |\n| Object storage classes Object archiving | Cloud Storage storage classes          |\nAs noted earlier, the features listed in the preceding table might look similar when you compare them. However, differences in the design and implementation of the features in the two cloud providers can have significant effects on your migration from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage.\n### Complete the assessment\nAfter you build the inventories from your Amazon S3 environment, complete the rest of the activities of the assessment phase as described in [Migrate to Google Cloud: Assess and discover your workloads](/solutions/migration-to-gcp-assessing-and-discovering-your-workloads) .\n## Plan and build your foundation\nThe plan and build phase of your migration to Google Cloud consists of the following tasks:\n- Build a resource hierarchy.\n- Configure identity and access management.\n- Set up billing.\n- Set up network connectivity.\n- Harden your security.\n- Set up logging, monitoring, and alerting.\nFor more information about each of these tasks, see [Migrate to Google Cloud: Build your foundation](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-building-your-foundation) .\n## Migrate data and workloads from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage\nTo migrate data from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage, we recommend that you design a data migration plan by following the guidance in [Migrate to Google Cloud: Transfer your large datasets](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-transferring-your-large-datasets) . That document recommends using [Storage Transfer Service](/storage-transfer/docs/overview) , a Google Cloud product that lets you migrate data from several sources to Cloud Storage, such as from on-premises environments or from other cloud storage providers. Storage Transfer Service supports several types of data transfer jobs, such as the following:\n- [Run-once transfer jobs](/storage-transfer/docs/create-transfers) , which transfer data from Amazon S3 or other supported sources to Cloud Storage on demand.\n- [Scheduled transfer jobs](/storage-transfer/docs/schedule-transfer-jobs) , which transfer data from Amazon S3 or other supported sources to Cloud Storage on a schedule.\n- [Event-driven transfer jobs](/storage-transfer/docs/event-driven-transfers) , which automatically transfer data when Amazon S3 sends Amazon S3 Event Notifications to Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS).\nTo implement a data migration plan, you can configure one or more data transfer jobs. For example, to reduce the length of cut-over windows during the migration, you can implement a [continuous replication](/architecture/migration-to-google-cloud-transferring-your-large-datasets#continuous_replication) data migration strategy as follows:\n- Configure a run-once transfer job to copy the data from an Amazon S3 bucket to the Cloud Storage bucket.\n- Perform data validation and consistency checks to compare data in the Amazon S3 bucket against the copied data in the Cloud Storage bucket.\n- Set up event-driven transfer jobs to automatically transfer data from the Amazon S3 bucket to the Cloud Storage bucket when the content of the Amazon S3 bucket changes.\n- Stop the workloads and services that have access to the data that's being migrated (that is, to the data that's involved in the previous step).\n- Refactor workloads to use Cloud Storage instead of Amazon S3. You can refactor your workloads by using one of the following approaches, or by using the approaches in sequence:- [Simple migration from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage](/storage/docs/aws-simple-migration) . In a simple migration, you use your existing tools and libraries that currently generate authenticated REST requests to Amazon S3 to instead generate authenticated requests to Cloud Storage.\n- [Fully migrate from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage](/storage/docs/migrating) . In a full migration, you can use all of the features of Cloud Storage, including multiple projects and OAuth 2.0 for authentication.\n- Wait for the replication to fully synchronize Cloud Storage with Amazon S3.\n- Start your workloads.\n- When you no longer need your Amazon S3 environment as a fallback option, retire it.\nStorage Transfer Service can preserve [certain metadata when you migrate objects from a supported source to Cloud Storage](/storage-transfer/docs/metadata-preservation) . We recommend that you assess whether Storage Transfer Service can migrate [the Amazon S3 metadata](/storage-transfer/docs/metadata-preservation#s3-to-cloud) that you're interested in.\nWhen you design your data migration plan, we recommend that you also assess AWS network egress costs and your Amazon S3 costs. For example, consider the following options to transfer data:\n- Across the public internet.\n- By using an interconnect link.\n- By using [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) .\nThe option that you choose can have an impact on your AWS network egress costs and your Amazon S3 costs. The option can also affect the amount of effort and resources that you need in order to provision and configure the infrastructure. For more information about costs, see the following:\n- [Understanding data transfer charges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/cur-data-transfers-charges.html) in the AWS documentation\n- [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing) \nWhen you migrate data from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage, we recommend that you [use VPC Service Controls to build a perimeter](/architecture/transferring-data-from-amazon-s3-to-cloud-storage-using-vpc-service-controls-and-storage-transfer-service) that explicitly denies communication between Google Cloud services unless the services are authorized.\n## Optimize your environment after migration\nOptimization is the last phase of your migration. In this phase, you iterate on optimization tasks until your environment meets your optimization requirements. The steps of this iteration are as follows:\n- Assess your current environment and your teams.\n- Establish your optimization requirements and goals.\n- Optimize your environment and your teams.\n- Tune your optimization process.\nYou repeat this sequence until you've achieved your optimization goals.\nFor more information about optimizing your Google Cloud environment, see [Migrate to Google Cloud: Optimize your environment](/solutions/migration-to-google-cloud-optimizing-your-environment) .\n## What's next\n- Learn [how to migrate from Amazon EC2 to Compute Engine](/architecture/migrate-amazon-ec2-to-compute-engine) .\n- Read about [other AWS to Google Cloud migration journeys](/architecture/migration-from-aws-get-started) .\n- Learn [how to compare AWS and Azure services to Google Cloud services](/free/docs/aws-azure-gcp-service-comparison) .\n- Learn when to [find help for your migrations](/architecture/migration-to-gcp-getting-started#finding_help) .\n- Explore reference architectures, diagrams, and best practices about Google Cloud.
