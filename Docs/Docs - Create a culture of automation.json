Continually aim to reduce or eliminate toil. Otherwise, operational work can eventually overwhelm operators, and any growth in product use or complexity can require additional staffing.\nAutomation is a key way to minimize toil. Automation also improves release velocity and helps minimize human-induced errors.\nFor more information, see [Eliminating Toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/eliminating-toil/) .\n", "content": "## Create an inventory and assess the cost of toil\nStart by creating an inventory and assessing the cost of toil on the teams managing your systems. Make this a continuous process, followed by investing in customized automation to extend what's already provided by Google Cloud services and partners. You can often modify Google Cloud's own automation\u2014for example, [Compute Engine's autoscaler](/compute/docs/autoscaler) .\n## Prioritize eliminating toil\nAutomation is useful but isn't a solution to all operational problems. As a first step in addressing known toil, we recommend reviewing your inventory of existing toil and prioritize eliminating as much toil as you can. Then, you can focus on automation.\n## Automate necessary toil\nSome toil in your systems cannot be eliminated. As a second step in addressing known toil, automate this toil using the solutions that Google Cloud provides through configurable automation.\nThe following are some areas where configurable automation or customized automation can assist your organization in eliminating toil:\n- Identity management\u2014for example, [Cloud Identity and Identity and Access Management](/iam) .\n- Google Cloud hosted solutions, as opposed to self-designed solutions\u2014for example, cluster management ( [Google Kubernetes Engine](/kubernetes-engine) (GKE)), relational database management ( [Cloud SQL](/sql) ), data warehouse management ( [BigQuery](/bigquery) ), and API management ( [Apigee](/apigee/api-management) ).\n- Google Cloud services and tenant provisioning\u2014for example [Terraform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-google-examples) and [Cloud Foundation Toolkit](/foundation-toolkit) .\n- Automated workflow orchestration for multi-step operations\u2014for example, [Cloud Composer](/composer) .\n- Additional capacity provisioning\u2014for example, several Google Cloud products, like [Compute Engine](/compute/docs/autoscaler) and [GKE](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-autoscaler) , offer configurable autoscaling. Evaluate the Google Cloud services you are using to determine if they include configurable autoscaling.\n- CI/CD pipelines with automated deployment\u2014for example, [Cloud Build](/build/docs) .\n- Canary analysis to validate deployments.\n- Automated model training (for machine learning)\u2014for example, [AutoML](/vertex-ai/docs/beginner/beginners-guide) .\nIf a Google Cloud product or service only partially satisfies your technical needs when automating or eliminating manual workflows, consider filing a feature request through your Google Cloud account representative. Your issue might be a priority for other customers or already a part of our roadmap. If so, knowing the feature's priority and timeline helps you to better assess the trade-offs of building your own solution versus waiting to use a Google Cloud feature.\n## Build or buy solutions for high-cost toil\nThe third step, which can be completed in parallel with the first and second steps, entails evaluating building or buying other solutions if your toil cost stays high\u2014for example, if toil takes a significant amount of time for any team managing your production systems.\nWhen building or buying solutions, consider integration, security, privacy, and compliance costs. Designing and implementing your own automation comes with maintenance costs and risks to reliability beyond its initial development and setup costs, so consider this option as a last resort.\n## What's next\nExplore other categories in the [Architecture Framework](/architecture/framework) such as system design, security, privacy, and compliance, reliability, cost optimization, and performance optimization.", "guide": "Docs"}
