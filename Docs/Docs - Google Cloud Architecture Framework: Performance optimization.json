For example, when the backend processing time of an application decreases, users experience faster response times, which can lead to higher user retention and more revenue.\nThere might be trade-offs between performance and cost. But sometimes, optimizing performance can help you reduce cost. \u200b\u200bFor example, autoscaling helps provide predictable performance when the load increases by ensuring that the resources aren't overloaded. Autoscaling also helps you reduce cost during periods of low load by removing unused resources.\nIn this category of the Architecture Framework, you learn to do the following:\n- [Implement the performance optimization process](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/process) .\n- [Monitor and analyze performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/monitor) .\n- [Optimize compute performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/compute) .\n- [Optimize storage performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/storage) .\n- [Optimize networking performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/networking) .\n- [Optimize database performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/databases) .\n- [Optimize analytics performance](/architecture/framework/performance-optimization/analytics) ", "content": ".", "guide": "Docs"}
