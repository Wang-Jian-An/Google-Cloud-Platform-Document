Each deployment archetype specifies a combination of failure domains where an application can run. These failure domains can be one or more [Google Cloud zones or regions](/architecture/infra-reliability-guide/building-blocks#regions_and_zones) , and they can extend to include your on-premises data centers or failure domains in other cloud providers.\nThe following diagram shows six applications deployed in Google Cloud. Each application uses a deployment archetype that meets its specific requirements.\nAs the preceding diagram shows, in an architecture that uses the hybrid or multicloud deployment archetype, the cloud topology is based on one of the archetypes: zonal, regional, multi-regional, or global. In this sense, the hybrid and multicloud deployment archetypes can be considered as deployment archetypes that include one of the basic archetypes.\n**Note:** Deployment archetypes are different from [location scopes](/architecture/infra-reliability-guide/building-blocks#location_scopes) . The location scope of a Google Cloud resource defines its availability boundary. For example, the location scope of a Compute Engine VM is . This means that if the Google Cloud zone in which a VM is provisioned has an outage, the availability of the VM is affected. However, by distributing VMs across multiple zones, you can build a highly available architecture that's based on the deployment archetype.\nChoosing a deployment archetype helps to simplify subsequent decisions regarding the Google Cloud products and features that you should use. For example, for a highly available containerized application, if you choose the regional deployment archetype, then regional Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters are more appropriate than zonal GKE clusters.\nWhen you choose a deployment archetype for an application, you need to consider tradeoffs between factors like availability, cost, and operational complexity. For example, if an application serves users in multiple countries and needs high availability, you might choose the multi-regional deployment archetype. But for an internal application that's used by employees in a single geographical region, you might prioritize cost over availability and, therefore, choose the regional deployment archetype.\n## Overview of the deployment archetypes\nThe following tabs provide definitions for the deployment archetypes and a summary of the use cases and design considerations for each.\nYour application runs within a single Google Cloud zone, as shown in the following diagram:| 0      | 1                                                              |\n|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Use cases    | Development and test environments. Applications that don't need high availability. Low-latency networking between application components. Migrating commodity workloads. Applications that use license-restricted software.       |\n| Design considerations | Downtime during zone outages. For business continuity, you can provision a passive replica of the application in another zone in the same region. If a zone outage occurs, you can restore the application to production by using the passive replica. |\n| More information  | See the following sections: Zonal deployment archetype Comparative analysis of all the deployment archetypes                                   |Your application runs independently in two or more zones within a single Google Cloud region, as shown in the following diagram:| 0      | 1                                                                         |\n|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Use cases    | Highly available applications that serves users within a geographic area. Compliance with data residency and sovereignty requirements.                                        |\n| Design considerations | Downtime during region outages. For business continuity, you can back up the application and data to another region. If a region outage occurs, you can use the backups in the other region to restore the application to production.

You can use [DNS routing policies](/dns/docs/policies-overview#routing_policies) to route incoming traffic to the regional load balancers. The regional load balancers then distribute the traffic to the zonal replicas of the application, as shown in the following diagram:| 0      | 1                                                         |\n|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Use cases    | Highly available application with geographically dispersed users.

A global [anycast](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast) load balancer distributes traffic to the region that's nearest to the user. Other components of the application stack can also be global, such as the database, cache, and object store.\nThe following diagram shows the globally distributed variant of the global deployment archetype. A global anycast load balancer forwards requests to an application stack that's distributed across multiple regions and that uses a globally replicated database.The following diagram shows a variant of the global deployment archetype with regionally isolated application stacks. A global anycast load balancer forwards requests to an application stack in one of the regions. All the application stacks use a single, globally replicated database.| 0      | 1                                                  |\n|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Use cases    | Highly available applications that serve globally dispersed users.
