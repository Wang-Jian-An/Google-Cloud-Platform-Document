This guide helps you understand how Google is able to support FedRAMP compliance and which Google Cloud tools, products, and services to configure to help meet your responsibilities under FedRAMP.\n", "content": "## Overview\nGoogle Cloud supports FedRAMP compliance, and provides specific details on the approach to security and data protection in the [Google security whitepaper](/security/overview/whitepaper) and in the [Google Infrastructure Security Design Overview](/security/infrastructure/design) . Although Google provides a secure and compliant cloud infrastructure, you are ultimately responsible for evaluating your own FedRAMP compliance. You're also responsible for ensuring that the environment and applications that you build on top of Google Cloud are properly configured and secured according to FedRAMP requirements.\nThis document outlines the [FedRAMP Authority to Operate (ATO)](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Authorization_Playbook.pdf) phases at a high level, explains the Google Cloud shared responsibility model, highlights customer-specific responsibilities, and suggests how to meet these requirements and guidelines on Google Cloud.\n## FedRAMP\nThe [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://www.fedramp.gov/about/) is a government-wide program that standardizes how the [Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)](https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act/) applies to cloud computing. It establishes a repeatable approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud-based services.\nUsing FedRAMP's standards and guidelines, you can secure sensitive, mission-essential, and mission-critical data in the cloud, making it possible to detect cybersecurity vulnerabilities quickly.\nAt a high level, FedRAMP has the following goals:\n- Ensure that cloud services and systems used by government agencies have adequate safeguards.\n- De-duplicate efforts and reduce risk management costs.\n- Enable government agencies to rapidly and cost effectively procure information systems and services.\nIn adherence to FedRAMP, federal government agencies must do the following:\n- Ensure that all cloud systems which process, transmit, and store government data use the FedRAMP security controls baseline.\n- Use the security assessment plan when granting security authorizations under FISMA.\n- Enforce FedRAMP requirements through contracts with cloud service providers (CSPs).\n### Authority to Operate (ATO)\nSuccessful implementation and execution of the FedRAMP accreditation process culminates with an Authority to Operate (ATO) in the cloud. There are two paths for FedRAMP ATO: P-ATO and Agency ATO.\nP-ATO, or Provisional Authority to Operate, is granted by the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB). The JAB is composed of CIOs from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DoD). The board defines the baseline FedRAMP security controls and establish the FedRAMP accreditation criteria for third-party assessment organizations (3PAOs). Organizations and agencies request to have their information system security package processed by the JAB, and the JAB then issues P-ATO to use cloud services.\nWith Agency ATO, the internal organization or agency designates authorizing officials (AOs) to conduct a risk review of the information system security package. The AO can engage 3PAOs or non-accredited, independent assessors (IAs) to review the information system security package. The AO, and later the agency or organization, then authorizes the information system's use of cloud services. The security package is also sent to the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) for review; GSA is the PMO for FedRAMP. After review, the PMO publishes the security package for other agencies and organizations to use.\n### Security assessment plan\nAuthorizing Officials (AOs) at agencies and organizations must incorporate the [FedRAMP Security Assessment Plan (SAP)](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Security-Assessment-Plan-(SAP)-Template.docx) into their internal authorization processes to ensure that they meet FedRAMP requirements for cloud services use. The SAF is implemented in four phases:\nYou or your AO [categorize](https://www.fedramp.gov/understanding-baselines-and-impact-levels/) your information system as a [Low](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SSP-Appendix-A-Low-FedRAMP-Security-Controls.docx) , [Moderate](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SSP-Appendix-A-Moderate-FedRAMP-Security-Controls.docx) , or [High](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SSP-Appendix-A-High-FedRAMP-Security-Controls.docx) impact system according to [FIPS PUB 199](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.199.pdf) security objectives for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nBased on the system's FIPS categorization, select the [FedRAMP security controls baseline](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Security_Controls_Baseline.xlsx) that correlates with the FIPS 199 categorization level of low, moderate, or high. You must then implement the security controls captured in the respective controls baseline. Alternative implementations and justification for why a control can't be met or implemented is also acceptable.\nCapture the details of the security controls implementation in a System Security Plan (SSP). We recommend that you select the SSP template according to the FedRAMP compliance level\u2014Low, Moderate, or High.\nThe SSP does the following:\n- Describes the security authorization boundary.\n- Explains how the system implementation addresses each FedRAMP security control.\n- Outlines system roles and responsibilities.\n- Defines expected system user behavior.\n- Exhibits how the system is architected and what the supporting infrastructure looks like.\nYou use the [FedRAMP authorization review template](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/Agency-ATO-Report-Template-Version.pdf) to track your ATO progress.\nFor more details about the implementation phases, see the [FedRAMP's agency authorization process](https://www.fedramp.gov/agency-authorization/) .\n### Cloud responsibility model\nConventional infrastructure technology (IT) required organizations and agencies to purchase, physical data center or colocation space, physical servers, networking equipment, software, licenses, and other devices for building systems and services. With cloud computing, a CSP invests in the physical hardware, data center, and global networking, while also providing virtual equipment, tools, and services for customers to use.\nThree cloud computing models exist: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS):\n- **In the IaaS model** , CSPs essentially supply a virtual data center in the cloud, and they deliver virtualized computing infrastructure such as servers, networks, and storage. Although CSPs manage the physical equipment and data centers for these resources, you are responsible for configuring and securing any of the platform or application resources that you run on the virtualized infrastructure.\n- **In the PaaS model** , CSPs not only provide and manage the infrastructure and virtualization layer, they also provide customers with a pre-developed, pre-configured platform for creating software, applications, and web services. PaaS makes it easy for developers to create applications and middleware without worrying about security and configuration of the underlying hardware.\n- **In the SaaS model** , CSPs manage the physical and virtual infrastructure and the platform layer while delivering cloud-based applications and services for customers to consume. Internet applications that run directly from the web browser or by going to a website are SaaS applications. With this model, organizations and agencies don't have to worry about installing, updating, or supporting applications; they simply manage system and data access policies.\nThe following figure highlights CSP responsibilities and your responsibilities both on-premises and across cloud computing models:### FedRAMP responsibility\nYou can view the cloud IT stack relative to four layers: the physical infrastructure layer, the cloud infrastructure layer, the cloud platform layer, and the cloud software layer. The following diagram shows these layers.\nThe numbered layers in the diagram correspond to the following:\n- **Software as a service.** Google Workspace is also certified as FedRAMP Moderate. In order to inherit these SaaS security controls, you can request a copy of [Google's ATO package](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/products?sort=productName) from the JAB and include a copy of [Google's attestation letter](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/2017_google_services_800-53_letter.pdf) in your package.\n- **Platform as a service.** In addition to Google Cloud's FedRAMP certified physical infrastructure, additional PaaS products and services are covered by FedRAMP, including App Engine, Cloud Storage, and database services. Use these pre-certified products and services wherever possible.\n- **Infrastructure as a service.** In addition to Google Cloud's FedRAMP certified physical infrastructure, additional IaaS products and services are covered by FedRAMP, including Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Compute Engine. Use these pre-certified products and services wherever possible.\n- **Physical infrastructure.** Google Cloud is certified by JAB as FedRAMP Moderate. In order to inherit these physical security controls, you can request a copy of Google's ATO package and include Google's attestation letter in your package.\nWith respect to FedRAMP ATO, each layer of the cloud IT stack is considered an independent control boundary, and each control boundary requires a separate ATO. This means that despite [Google Cloud's FedRAMP compliance](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/products?sort=productName) and having dozens of Google Cloud services that are covered by FedRAMP, you are still required to implement FedRAMP security baseline controls and the SAF process to qualify your cloud systems and workloads as FedRAMP compliant.\nThere are two types of FedRAMP security controls across Low, Moderate, and High compliance baselines: controls implemented by the information system, and controls implemented by the organization. As your organization or agency builds out FedRAMP-compliant systems on Google Cloud, you inherit the physical infrastructure security controls that Google meets under its [FedRAMP certification](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/products?sort=productName) . You also inherit any physical infrastructure, IaaS, and PaaS security controls that are built into [Google's FedRAMP compliant products and services](/security/compliance/fedramp) , and into all SaaS controls when using Google Workspace. However, you are required to implement all other security controls and configurations at the IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS levels, as defined by the FedRAMP security controls baseline.\n## FedRAMP implementation recommendations\nAs mentioned, you inherit some security controls from the CSP. For other controls, you must specifically configure them and create **organization-defined** policies, rules, and regulations to meet each control.\nThis section recommends aids for implementing [NIST 800-53](/security/compliance/nist800-53) security controls in the cloud by using organization-defined policies with Google Cloud tools, services, and best practices.\n**Note:** Services listed in this section marked with * are not currently covered by FedRAMP, and services marked with + are not built-in Google Cloud services.\n### Access control\nTo manage access control in Google Cloud, define organization admins who will manage information system accounts in the cloud. Place those admins in access control groups using [Cloud Identity](/identity) , [Admin Console](https://workspace.google.com/products/admin/) , or some other identity provider (for example, Active Directory or LDAP), ensuring that third-party identity providers are federated with Google Cloud. Use [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/iam) to assign roles and permissions to administrative groups, implementing least privilege and separation of duties.\nDevelop an **organization-wide access control policy** for information system accounts in the cloud. Define the parameters and procedures by which your organization creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts.\n**In the access control policy** , define the parameters and procedures by which your organization will create, enable, modify, disable, and remove information system accounts. Define the conditions under which information system accounts should be used.\nAlso, identify the [time period of inactivity](https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/7576830?hl=en) in which users will be required to log out of a system (for example, after *x* minutes, hours, or days). Use Cloud Identity, Admin Console, or application configurations to force users to sign out or re-authenticate after the defined time period.\nDefine what actions should be taken when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate for a user in your organization. Google's * [Policy Intelligence](/policy-intelligence) has an IAM Recommender feature that helps you remove unwanted access to Google Cloud resources by using machine learning to make smart access control recommendations.\nDefine conditions under which groups accounts are appropriate. Use Cloud Identity or Admin Console to create groups or service accounts. Assign roles and permissions to shared groups and service accounts by using IAM. Use service accounts whenever possible. Specify what atypical use of an information system account is for your organization. When you detect atypical use, use tools such as [Google Cloud Observability](/products/operations) or * [Security Command Center](/security-command-center) to alert information system admins.\nFollow these guidelines to aid in implementing these security controls: AC-02, AC-02 (04), AC-02 (05), AC-02 (07), AC-02 (09), AC-02 (11), AC-02 (12), AC-05, AC-06 (01), AC-06 (03), AC-06 (05), AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-12, SI-04, SI-04 (05), SI-04 (11), SI-04 (18), SI-04 (19), SI-04 (20), SI-04 (22), SI-04 (23).\n**In the organization-wide access control policy** , define information-flow control policies for your organization. Identify prohibited or restricted ports, protocols, and services. Define requirements and restrictions for interconnections to internal and external systems. Use tools such as [Virtual Private Cloud](/vpc) to create firewalls, logically isolated networks, and subnetworks. Help control the flow of information by implementing [Cloud Load Balancing](/load-balancing) , * [Traffic Director](/traffic-director) , and [VPC Service Controls](/vpc-service-controls) .\nWhen setting information-flow control policies, identify controlled network access points for your organization. Use tools such as [Identity-Aware Proxy](/iap) to provide context-based access to cloud resources for remote and onsite users. Use [Cloud VPN](/hybrid-connectivity) or [Cloud Interconnect](/hybrid-connectivity) to provide secure, direct access to VPCs.\nSet organization-wide policies for executing privileged commands and accessing secure data over remote access. Use IAM and VPC Service Controls to restrict access to sensitive data and workloads.\nFollow these guidelines to aid in implementing these security controls: AC-04, AC-04 (08), AC-04 (21), AC-17 (03), AC-17 (04), CA-03 (03), CA-03 (05), CM-07, CM-07(01), CM-07(02).\n**In the access control policy** , specify how long a user should be delayed from accessing a login prompt when 3 unsuccessful login attempts have been attempted in a 15-minute period. Define conditions and triggers under which user sessions are terminated or disconnected.\nUse [Cloud Identity Premium Edition](https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/7431902?hl=en) or Admin Console to manage mobile devices that connect to your network, including BYOD. Create organization-wide security policies that apply to mobile devices. Outline requirements and procedures for purging and wiping mobile devices after consecutive unsuccessful login attempts.\nDevelop organization-wide language and system-use notifications that provide privacy policies, terms of use, and security notices to users who are accessing the information system. Define the conditions under which organization-wide notifications are displayed before granting users access. [Pub/Sub](/pubsub) is a global messaging and event ingestion system that you can use to push notifications to applications and end users. You can also use * [Chrome Enterprise Suite](https://chromeenterprise.google/) , including * [Chrome Browser](https://chromeenterprise.google/browser/) and * [Chrome OS](https://chromeenterprise.google/os/) , with the * [Push API](https://w3c.github.io/push-api/) and * [Notifications API](https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/) to send notifications and updates to users.\nFollow these guidelines to aid in implementing these security controls: AC-07, AC-07 (02), AC-08, AC-12, AC-12 (01).\n**In the access control policy** , define user actions that can be performed on an information system [without identification and authentication](/iam/docs/overview#allusers) . Use IAM to regulate user access to view, create, delete, and modify specific resources.\nDevelop organization-wide policies for information sharing. Determine circumstances under which information can be shared and when user discretion is required for sharing information. Employ processes to assist users with sharing information and collaborating across the organization. [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/features/) has a great feature set for controlled collaboration and engagement across teams.\nFollow these guidelines to aid in implementing these security controls: AC-14, AC-19 (05), AC-21.\n### Awareness and training\n**Create security policies and associated training materials** to disseminate to users and security groups across your organization at least annually. Google offers [Professional Services](/consulting) options for educating users on cloud security, including but not limited to a [Cloud Discover Security](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/cloud_discover_security.pdf) engagement and a [Google Workspace Security Assessment](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/security_assessment.pdf) .\nUpdate security policies and training at least annually.\nFollow these guidelines to aid in implementing security control AT-01.\n### Auditing and accountability\n**Create organization-wide auditing policies and accountability controls** that address procedures and implementation requirements for auditing personnel, events, and actions that are tied to cloud information systems.\n**In the organization-wide auditing policy** , outline events that should be audited in your organization's information systems, and the auditing frequency. Examples of logged events include successful and unsuccessful account login events, account management events, object access, policy change, privilege functions, process tracking, and system events. For web applications, examples include admin activity, authentication checks, authorization checks, data deletions, data access, data changes, and permission changes. Define additional events of interest for your organization.\nFor the auditing policy, we also recommend that you specify indications of inappropriate or unusual activity for your organization. Monitor, log, and flag these activities regularly (at least weekly).\nUse [Google Cloud Observability](/products/operations) to manage logging, monitoring, and alerting for your Google Cloud, on-premises, or other cloud environments. Use Google Cloud Observability to configure and track security events in your organization. You can also use Cloud Monitoring to set custom metrics to monitor for organization-defined events in audit records.\nEnable information systems to alert admins of audit processing failures. You can implement these alerts by using tools like Pub/Sub and [alerting](/monitoring/alerts) .\nSet standards for alerting admins within a set time period (for example, within 15 minutes), in the event of a system or functional failure, to include when audit records reach a set threshold or volume capacity. Determine an organization-wide granularity of time measurement, by which audit records should be time-stamped and logged. Define the level of tolerance for time-stamped records in the information system audit trail (for example, nearly real-time or within 20 minutes).\nSet [VPC resource quotas](/vpc/docs/quota) to establish the capacity thresholds for audit record storage. Configure [budget alerts](/billing/docs/how-to/budgets) to notify admins when a percentage of a resource limit has been reached or exceeded.\nDefine organization-wide storage requirements for audit data and records, to include audit log availability and retention requirements. Use [Cloud Storage](/storage) to store and archive audit logs, and [BigQuery](/bigquery) to perform further log analysis.\nFollow these guidelines to aid in implementing these security controls: AU-01, AU-02, AU-04, AU-05, AU-05 (01), AU-06, AU-07 (01), AU-08, AU-08 (01), AU-09 (04), AU-09 (04), AU-12, AU-12 (01), AU-12 (03), CA-07.\n### Security assessment and authorization\n**Develop an organization-wide security assessment and authorization policy** that defines the procedures and implementation requirements of organization security assessments, security controls, and authorization controls.\n**In the security assessment and authorization policy** , define the level of independence required for security assessment teams to conduct impartial assessments of information systems in the cloud. Identify the information systems that need to be assessed by an independent assessor.\nSecurity assessments should minimally cover the following:\n- In-depth monitoring\n- Vulnerability scanning\n- Malicious user testing\n- Insider threat assessment\n- Performance and load testing\nYour organization should define additional requirements and forms of security assessment.\nMake sure that your security assessment and authorization policy specifies security system classifications and requirements, including requirements for unclassified and non-national security systems.\n**In theinformation flow control policies for your organization** , outline requirements and restrictions for interconnections to internal and external systems. Set VPC firewall rules to allow and deny traffic to information systems, and use VPC Service Controls to protect sensitive data by using security parameters.\n**Set organization-wideauditing and accountability policies** that enforce continuous monitoring requirements (CA-07).\nFollow these guidelines to aid in implementing these security controls: CA-01, CA-02, CA-02 (01), CA-02 (02), CA-02 (03), CA-03 (03), CA-03 (05), CA-07, CA-07 (01), CA-08, CA-09.\n### Configuration management\n**Create an organization-wide configuration management policy** that defines the procedures and implementation requirements for organization-wide configuration management controls, roles, responsibilities, scope, and compliance.\nStandardize configuration setting requirements for organization-owned information systems and system components. Provide operational requirements and procedures for configuring information systems. Explicitly call out how many previous versions of a baseline configuration the system admins are required to retain for information system rollback support. Use [Google's suite of configuration management tools](/solutions/configuration-management) to control IT system configurations as code, and monitor configuration changes by using *Policy Intelligence or *Security Command Center.\nSpecify configuration requirements for each type of information system in your organization (for example, cloud, on-premises, hybrid, unclassified, controlled unclassified information (CUI), or classified). Also define security safeguard requirements for organization-owned and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) devices to include identifying safe and unsafe geographic locations. Use Identity-Aware Proxy to enforce context-based access controls to organization-owned data, including access controls by geographic location. Use Cloud Identity Premium edition or Admin Console to enforce security configurations on mobile devices that connect to the corporate network.\n**In the configuration management policy** , define an organization-wide configuration change-control element, such as a change-control committee or board. Document how frequently the committee meets and under which conditions. Establish a formal body for reviewing and approving configuration changes.\nIdentify the configuration management approval authorities for your organization. These admins review requests for changes to information systems. Define the time period that authorities have to approve or disapprove change requests. Provide guidance for change implementers to notify approval authorities when information system changes have been completed.\nSet restrictions on the use of open source software across your organization, to include the specification of what software is approved and not approved for use. Use Cloud Identity or Admin Console to enforce approved applications and software for your organization. With Cloud Identity Premium, you can enable single sign-on and multi-factor authentication for third-party applications.\nUse tools such as alerting to send notifications to security admins when configuration changes are logged.
