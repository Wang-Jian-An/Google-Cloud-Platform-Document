{"title": "Vertex AI - Create a feature", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform", "abstract": "# Vertex AI - Create a feature\nYou can create a feature after you [create a feature group and associate aBigQuery table or BigQuery view with it](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featuregroup) . You can create multiple features for a feature group and associate each feature with a specific column in the BigQuery data source. For information about how to use BigQuery, refer to the [BigQuery documentation](/bigquery/docs) .\nFor example, if the feature group `featuregroup1` is associated with the BigQuery table `datasource_1` containing feature values in columns `fval1` and `fval2` , then you can create feature `feature_1` under `featuregroup1` and associate it with the feature values in column `fval1` . Similarly, you can create another feature named `feature_2` and associate it with the feature values in column `fval2` .\nRegistering your data source using feature groups and features has the following advantages:\n- You can define a feature view for online serving by using specific feature columns from multiple BigQuery data sources.\n- You can format your data as a time series by including the `feature_timestamp` column. Vertex AI Feature Store serves only the latest feature values from the feature data and excludes historical values.\nUse the following samples to create a feature within a feature group and associate a column containing feature values from the BigQuery data source registered for the feature group.\nUse the following instructions to add features to an existing feature group using the Google Cloud console.- In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to the **Feature Store** page. [Go to the Feature Store page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/feature-store) \n- In the **Feature groups** section, click more_vert in the row corresponding to the feature group where you want to add a feature, and then click **Add features** .\n- For each feature, enter a **Feature name** and click the corresponding BigQuery source column name in the list. To add more features, click **Add another feature** .\n- Click **Create** .\nTo create a [Feature](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups.features#resource:-feature) resource, send a `POST` request by using the [features.create](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups.features/create) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the feature group is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the feature group where you want to create the feature.\n- : The name of the new feature you want to create.\n- : Optional: The column from the BigQuery table or  view that you want to associate with the feature. If you don't specify this parameter, it's set  to, by default.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPOST https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATUREGROUP_NAME/features?feature_id=FEATURE_NAME\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"version_column_name\": \"VERSION_COLUMN_NAME\"\n}\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nSave the request body in a file named `request.json` ,  and execute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X POST \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\" \\ -d @request.json \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATUREGROUP_NAME/features?feature_id=FEATURE_NAME\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nSave the request body in a file named `request.json` ,  and execute the following command:\n```\n$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token$headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $cred\" }Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: \"application/json; charset=utf-8\" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATUREGROUP_NAME/features?feature_id=FEATURE_NAME\" | Select-Object -Expand Content\n```\nYou should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATUREGROUP_NAME/features/FEATURE_NAME/operations/OPERATION_ID\",\n \"metadata\": {\n \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.UpdateFeatureOperationMetadata\",\n \"genericMetadata\": {\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-09-18T02:36:22.870679Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-09-18T02:36:22.870679Z\"\n }\n }\n}\n```\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn how to [list all features in a feature group](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/list-features) .\n- Learn how to [update a feature](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-feature) .\n- Learn how to [delete a feature](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/delete-feature) .\n- Learn how to [update a feature group](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-featuregroup) .\n- [Online serving types](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/online-serving-types) in Vertex AI Feature Store.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
