Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nThis document describes how to provision API hub using the user interface (UI). This is the recommended method for Provisioning API hub; however, you can also provision API hub using the [command line](/apigee/docs/api-hub/provision-cli) .\n**Required permissions:** You must have administrator permissions to provision API hub. See [ Set up IAM permissions](/apigee/docs/api-hub/permissions#set-up-iam-permissions) for instructions.\n", "content": "## Summary of steps\nThe provisioning steps are as follows:\n- Verify that you have met the [API hub prerequisites](/apigee/docs/api-hub/prerequisites) (except for the steps in the **Software** row).\n- [Open API hub](#step-console) and [select your Google Cloud project](#step-project) .\n- [Enable APIs](#step-apis) . Apigee requires you to enable a  few Google Cloud APIs.\n- [Specify a Hosting location](#step-hosting) . You must  specify the physical location of your API hub.\n- [Specify or create a CMEK](#step-cmek) . Because information about internal APIs may  be considered sensitive, Apigee requires a CMEK to encrypt and decrypt  (protect) data at rest. The CMEK must be in the same region as the **Hosting location** .\n- Wait 30 minutes for provisioning to complete.## Provisioning steps\nTo launch the API hub provisioning wizard:\n- Ensure that you have met the prerequisites described in [API hub prerequisites](/apigee/docs/api-hub/prerequisites) .\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **API hub** page. [ Go to API hub](https://console.cloud.google.com/apigee/hub/apis) \n- Select your project: \n- If your project has not yet been provisioned for API hub, **Start with Apigee API hub** is displayed. Click **Get started** . \n- The provisioning wizard starts: \n- Click **Enable APIs** . This step takes a few seconds to complete.\n- For **Hosting location** , select a **Region** , for example, `us-central1` . \n- Click **Set location** .\n- For **Encryption** , click **Choose a customer-managed encryption key** . \n- If you already have a CMEK, you can select it, otherwise click **Create key** . **Create a new key** is displayed. \n- Select **Create key ring** . \n- Type a **Key ring name** .\n- Select a **Key ring location** . This location is restricted to the  hosting location you chose in the previous step to ensure that the key  and data remain in the same region.\n- Click **Continue** .\n- Type a **Key name** . \n- Select a **Protection level** , for example, **Software** .\n- Click **Continue** .\n- If the **Review** page looks correct, click **Create** . \n- Click **Confirm encryption key** . \n- Click **Create service identity & grant permissions** . \n- Click **Submit** . \n- **Finalizing your registry** is displayed. It takes about 30 minutes  to provision. \n- When provisioning is complete, **Your registry is ready** displays. ## Next steps\nSee [Next steps](/apigee/docs/api-hub/next-steps) for some tips on how to get started using API hub.", "guide": "Apigee"}
