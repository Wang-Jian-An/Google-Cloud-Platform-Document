Storage systems in Google Distributed Cloud Hosted (GDCH), such as Server Keys for disk encryption and storage data management software for block storage, create the keys and represent them as resources.\nThe PA views the keys, pulls their audit logs, and deletes them to erase data graphically. The PA cannot directly create keys. The storage systems create them as necessary.\n**Note:** After the storage systems create the keys, it might take a few minutes for them to appear in each resource.\nGDCH encrypts all data at rest. It uses the HSM for all data at rest and all servers. Because you have access to the resource for keys, you can manage the keys that protect your data at rest. For more details on encryption in GDCH, see [Encryption at rest](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/platform/pa-user/encryption-at-rest) .\n**Warning:** Deleting keys wipes out your entire data. Delete your keys with caution for the stability of the system.\n", "content": "## Service endpoint and discovery document\nUse the `kubectl proxy` command to access the following HSM API endpoint in your browser and obtain the discovery document for the KMS API:\n```\nhttps://GDCH_API_SERVER_ENDPOINT/apis/hsm.gdc.goog/v1\n```\nReplace with the endpoint of the GDCH API server.\nThe `kubectl proxy` command opens a proxy to the Kubernetes API server on your local machine. When the command is running, access the document through the following URL:\n`http://127.0.0.1:8001/apis/hsm.gdc.goog/v1`", "guide": "Documentation"}
