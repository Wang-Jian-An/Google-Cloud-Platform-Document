You can now use both Apigee Integration and Application Integration within the same Google Cloud project. [Learn more](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/using-application-integration)\nThis section describes Apigee Integration quotas and limits you should consider as you design, build, and manage your integrations. The Apigee Integration feature is designed for stability and performance when configured for use cases within these quotas and limits.\nA restricts how much of a particular shared Google Cloud resource your Cloud project can use, including hardware, software, and network components.\nQuotas are part of a system that does the following:\n- Monitors your use or consumption of Google Cloud products and services.\n- Restricts your consumption of those resources for reasons including ensuring fairness and reducing spikes in usage.\n- Maintains configurations that automatically enforce prescribed restrictions.\n- Provides a means to make or request changes to the quota.\nWhen a is exceeded, in most cases, the system immediately blocks access to the relevant Google resource, and the task that you're trying to perform fails. In most cases, quotas apply to each Cloud project and are shared across all applications and IP addresses that use that Cloud project.\nThere are also on Apigee Integration resources. These are unrelated to the quota system. Limits cannot be changed unless otherwise stated.\n", "content": "## \n Resource quotas\n## \n Usage limits### Data processing limits\nWe don't recommend using integrations in the following scenarios:\n- Integration requires movement of bulk data or focus on extract, transform, and  load (ETL) processes.\n- Cumulative size of all the integration data is **greater than** `10 MB`during  execution.When calculating the cumulative data size, add the size of all types of data  such as input variables, output variables, and other intermediate task variables. **Caution:** If the data size exceeds 10 MB, Apigee Integration runs the integration,  but disables [local logging](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/local-logging) . As a result, you  can't view the full execution logs, apply retry strategy, or monitor integrations in the [monitoring dashboard](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/monitoring-dashboard) .## Supported regions\nApigee Integration supports data plane and runtime regionalization. During the integration creation process, users can select the specific region for data and execution to reside.\n**Deprecated:** [US multi-region (us)](/docs/geography-and-regions#multiregional_resources) for Apigee Integration is deprecated. As of **November 10, 2022** , you can no longer create an integration in the US multi-region (us) location. Any existing integration running in US multi-region (us) will be stopped on or after **January 10, 2023** .It's recommended that you perform the following actions before **January 10, 2023** :- Clone your existing integrations to,,, or any of the [supported regions](#supported-regions) . For information about how to clone an integration, see [Clone integrations](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/clone-integration) .\n- Migrate your existing integration proxies to,,, or any of the [supported regions](#supported-regions) . You can do this by manually updating the`IntegrationRegion`child element in the [SetIntegrationRequest](/apigee/docs/api-platform/reference/policies/set-integration-request-policy) policy.\nThe following table lists the regions where Apigee Integration is available.\n| Region description | Region name    | Details |\n|:---------------------|:------------------------|:----------|\n| nan     | nan      | nan  |\n| Oregon    | us-west1    | Low CO2 |\n| Los Angeles   | us-west2    | nan  |\n| Salt Lake City  | us-west3    | nan  |\n| Las Vegas   | us-west4    | nan  |\n| South Carolina  | us-east1    | nan  |\n| Northern Virginia | us-east4    | nan  |\n| Columbus    | us-east5    | nan  |\n| Iowa     | us-central1    | Low CO2 |\n| Dallas    | us-south1    | nan  |\n| Montr\u00e9al    | northamerica-northeast1 | nan  |\n| Toronto    | northamerica-northeast2 | nan  |\n| S\u00e3o Paulo   | southamerica-east1  | Low CO2 |\n| Santiago    | southamerica-west1  | Low CO2 || Region description | Region name  | Details |\n|:---------------------|:------------------|:----------|\n| Belgium    | europe-west1  | Low CO2 |\n| London    | europe-west2  | nan  |\n| Frankfurt   | europe-west3  | nan  |\n| Netherlands   | europe-west4  | nan  |\n| Zurich    | europe-west6  | Low CO2 |\n| Paris    | europe-west9  | Low CO2 |\n| Berlin    | europe-west10  | nan  |\n| Turin    | europe-west12  | nan  |\n| Finland    | europe-north1  | Low CO2 |\n| Warsaw    | europe-central2 | nan  |\n| Madrid    | europe-southwest1 | nan  || Region description | Region name   |\n|:---------------------|:---------------------|\n| Taiwan    | asia-east1   |\n| Hong Kong   | asia-east2   |\n| Mumbai    | asia-south1   |\n| Delhi    | asia-south2   |\n| Tokyo    | asia-northeast1  |\n| Osaka    | asia-northeast2  |\n| Seoul    | asia-northeast3  |\n| Singapore   | asia-southeast1  |\n| Jakarta    | asia-southeast2  |\n| Sydney    | australia-southeast1 |\n| Melbourne   | australia-southeast2 || Region description | Region name |\n|:---------------------|:--------------|\n| Doha     | me-central1 |\n| Dammam    | me-central2 |\n| Tel Aviv    | me-west1  |", "guide": "Apigee"}
