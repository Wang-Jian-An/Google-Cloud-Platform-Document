It manages the lifecycle of clusters in a given organization, such as installing, upgrading, and uninstalling.\nTo use the Cluster API, we recommend that you use the GDCH console. If your application needs to use your own libraries to call this API, use the following example and the [full API definition](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/apis/service/cluster/v1/cluster-v1) to build your requests.\n", "content": "## Service endpoint and discovery document\nThe API endpoint for the Cluster API is: `https://` `` `/apis/cluster.gdc.goog/v1` where `` is the endpoint of the GDCH API server.\nUsing the `kubectl proxy` command, you can access that URL in your browser or with a tool such as `curl` to get the discovery document for the Cluster API. The `kubectl proxy` command opens up a proxy to the Kubernetes API server on your local machine. Once that command is running, you can access the document at the following URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/apis/cluster.gdc.goog/v1` .\n## Example Cluster resource\nThe following is an example of a `Cluster` object configured as a user cluster:\n```\napiVersion: cluster.gdc.goog/v1kind: Clustermetadata:\u00a0 name: user-vm-1\u00a0 namespace: platformspec:\u00a0 clusterNetwork:\u00a0 \u00a0 podCIDRSize: 21\u00a0 \u00a0 serviceCIDRSize: 23\u00a0 initialVersion:\u00a0 \u00a0 kubernetesVersion: 1.27.1-gke.700\u00a0 loadBalancer:\u00a0 \u00a0 ingressServiceIPSize: 21\u00a0 nodePools:\u00a0 - machineTypeName: n2-standard-8-gdc\u00a0 \u00a0 name: worker-node-pool\u00a0 \u00a0 nodeCount: 3\u00a0 releaseChannel:\u00a0 \u00a0 channel: UNSPECIFIED\n```", "guide": "Documentation"}
