It's the same database that powers many core Google services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail. Bigtable is designed to handle massive workloads at consistent low latency and high throughput, so it's a great choice for both operational and analytical applications, including IoT, user analytics, and financial data analysis.\nBigtable is an excellent option for any Apache Spark or Hadoop uses that require [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) . Bigtable supports the [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) 1.0+ APIs and offers a [Bigtable HBase client in Maven](/bigtable/docs/using-maven) , so it is easy to use Bigtable with Dataproc.\n", "content": "## Using Bigtable with Dataproc\nA Spark example that uses Bigtable with Dataproc is available in the [java-docs-samples repository onGitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/tree/master/bigtable/spark) under the Bigtable directory.\nTo run this example, follow the [directions in the Spark example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/tree/master/bigtable/spark) .
