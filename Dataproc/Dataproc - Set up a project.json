If you plan on using the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI [gcloud](/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc) command-line tool to create and manage clusters and to submit jobs, you only need to be logged in to the SDK (with`gcloud init`as shown above); you do not need to separately obtain API credentials.\n## Set up a VM (optional)\nIf you plan to run [gcloud CLI](/sdk/docs) from a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance, the VM must be set up to access Google Cloud services.\nTo test whether your VM is set up correctly, run `gcloud compute instances describe` `` from the command line. A service account must be listed that includes the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` scope. If you can't find the scope, see [Changing the service account and access scopes for an instance](/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#changeserviceaccountandscopes) .\n**Use Cloud Shell to run\ngcloud CLI commands.** As an alternative to setting up your own VM to run SDK commands, open a [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs/quickstart) session to automatically provision a VM with the necessary scopes, and then run gcloud CLI commands from Cloud Shell.\n[Next Step: Create a Cluster](/dataproc/docs/guides/create-cluster)", "guide": "Dataproc"}
