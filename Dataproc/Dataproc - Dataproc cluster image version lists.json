{"title": "Dataproc - Dataproc cluster image version lists", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/versioning/dataproc-version-clusters", "abstract": "# Dataproc - Dataproc cluster image version lists\nGoogle Dataproc uses Ubuntu, Debian, and Rocky Linux image versions to bundle operating system, big data components, and Google Cloud Platform connectors into one package that is deployed on a cluster. For more information, see [Dataproc Versioning](/dataproc/docs/concepts/versioning/overview) .\n- Dataproc image versions are supported for 24 months after their initial release.\n- Dataproc image versions continue to be available for 24 months after their end-of-support date.", "content": "## Default Dataproc image version\nDataproc updates the default image version to the latest generally available Debian-based Dataproc image version one month after its General availability (GA) release date.\n## Supported Dataproc versions\nDataproc prevents the creation of clusters with image versions prior to 1.3.95, 1.4.77, 1.5.53, and 2.0.27, which were affected by [Apache Log4j security vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) Dataproc also prevents cluster creation for Dataproc image versions 0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, and 1.2.x. Dataproc advises that, when possible, you create Dataproc clusters with the latest sub-minor image versions. See the [Dataproc release notes](/dataproc/docs/release-notes) for specific image and `log4j` update information.\n### Debian images\nThe following **Debian-based** image versions are supported in Dataproc clusters. Note that new clusters will be created to include any sub-minor patches that have been made to a version since its release.\nWhen creating a Debian-based cluster, you can omit the image version OS Distribution Code suffix, for example by specifying`2.0`to select the`2.0-debian10`image. The OS suffix **must** be used to select a Rocky Linux or Ubuntu-based image, for example by specifying`2.0-ubuntu18`. See [Selecting versions](/dataproc/docs/concepts/versioning/overview#selecting_versions) for image selection examples.\n| Version  | Last Updated | Released On | Supported Until | Available Until | Notes       |\n|:-------------|:---------------|:--------------|:------------------|:------------------|:------------------------------|\n| 2.2-debian12 | 2024/03/14  | 2023/12/08 | 2025/12/31  | 2027/12/31  | General availability release. |\n| 2.1-debian11 | 2024/03/14  | 2022/12/12 | 2024/12/31  | 2026/12/31  | General availability release. |\n| 2.0-debian10 | 2024/03/14  | 2021/01/22 | 2024/07/31  | 2026/07/31  | General availability release. |\n### Ubuntu images\nThe following **Ubuntu LTS-based** image versions are supported in Dataproc clusters.

Dataproc does not provide updates and support for clusters created with these versions. Although you can continue running a cluster that was created with an unsupported version, replacing the cluster with a new cluster that is created with a supported version is recommended.\n| Version      | Includes                                               | Released On         | Last Updated | Notes                                                  |\n|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.5-debian10/-ubuntu18/-rocky8 | Apache Spark 2.4.8 Apache Hadoop 2.10.2 Apache Pig 0.17.0 Apache Hive 2.3.7 Cloud Storage connector 2.1.9-hadoop2 Python 3.7 Scala 2.12.10 Zookeeper 3.4.14         | 2020/03/25:debian10/ubuntu18 2022/02/18:rocky8 | 2023/04/28  | Unsupported as of 2023/04/28. 1.5.89-debian10/-ubuntu18/-rocky8 was the final released version.                            |\n| 2.0-centos8     | Apache Spark 3.1.2 Apache Hadoop 3.2.2 Apache Pig 0.18.0-SNAPSHOT Apache Hive 3.1.2 Cloud Storage connector 2.2.4-hadoop3 Python 3.8 Scala 2.12.14 Zookeeper 3.4.14       | 2021/03/16          | 2022/02/01  | Unsupported as of 2022/02/01. 2.0.30-centos8 was the final released version.                                |\n| 1.5-centos8     | Apache Spark 2.4.8 Apache Hadoop 2.10.1 Apache Pig 0.17.0 Apache Hive 2.3.7 Cloud Storage connector 2.1.5-hadoop2 Python 3.7 Scala 2.12.10 Zookeeper 3.4.14         | 2020/12/14          | 2022/02/01  | Unsupported as of 2022/02/01. 1.5.56-centos8 was the final released version.                                |\n| 1.4-debian10/-ubuntu18   | Apache Spark 2.4.8 Apache Hadoop 2.9.2 Apache Pig 0.17.0 Apache Hive 2.3.7 Cloud Storage connector 1.9.18-hadoop2 Python 3.6 Scala 2.11.12 Zookeeper 3.4.14         | 2019/03/22          | 2022/02/01  | Unsupported as of 2022/02/01. 1.4.80-debian10/-ubuntu18 was the final released version.                              |\n| 1.3-debian10/-ubuntu18   | Apache Spark 2.3.4 Apache Hadoop 2.9.2 Apache Pig 0.17.0 Apache Hive 2.3.7 Cloud Storage connector 1.9.18-hadoop2 Python 2.7 Scala 2.11.8 Zookeeper 3.4.13         | 2018/06/29          | 2021/12/22  | Unsupported as of 2021/08/01. 1.3.95-debian10/-ubuntu18 was the final released version, which has log4j2 vulnerabilities addressed.
