You can install additional components, called \"optional components\", on the cluster when you create the cluster. Adding optional components to a cluster is similar to adding components through the use of [initialization actions](/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/init-actions) , but has the following advantages:\n- Faster cluster startup times\n- Tested compatibility with specific Dataproc versions\n- Use of a cluster parameter instead of an initialization action script\n- Optional components are integrated with other Dataproc components. For example, when Anaconda and Zeppelin are installed on a cluster, Zeppelin will make use of Anaconda's Python interpreter and libraries.\nOptional components are installed on a cluster before any [initialization actions](/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/init-actions) are run on the cluster.\n", "content": "## Available optional components\n| Optional component | COMPONENT_NAME in gcloud commands and API requests | Image Version         | Release Stage |\n|:---------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|:----------------|\n| Anaconda    | ANACONDA            | 1.3 and later (not available in 2.0 and later) | GA    |\n| Docker    | DOCKER            | 1.5 and later         | GA    |\n| Flink    | FLINK             | 1.5 and later         | GA    |\n| nan     | nan             | nan            | nan    |\n| HBase    | HBASE             | 1.5 and later (not available in 2.1 and later) | Beta   |\n| nan     | nan             | nan            | nan    |\n| Hive WebHCat   | HIVE_WEBHCAT           | 1.3 and later         | GA    |\n| Hudi     | Hudi             | 1.5 and later         | GA    |\n| Jupyter Notebook  | JUPYTER            | 1.3 and later         | GA    |\n| Presto    | PRESTO            | 1.3 and later (not available in 2.1 and later) | GA    |\n| Ranger    | RANGER            | 1.3 and later         | GA    |\n| Solr     | SOLR             | 1.3 and later         | GA    |\n| Trino    | TRINO             | 2.1 and later         | GA    |\n| Zeppelin Notebook | ZEPPELIN            | 1.3 and later         | GA    |\n| Zookeeper   | ZOOKEEPER            | 1.0 and later         | GA    |\nSee [Cluster web interfaces](/dataproc/docs/concepts/accessing/cluster-web-interfaces) for connecting to component Web interfaces running on clusters.
