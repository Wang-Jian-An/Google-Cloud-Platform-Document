To configure Cassandra properly for a production environment, you must configure a [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes) definition that is backed by a solid-state drive (SSD) and make it the default class. See [StorageClass configuration](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.1/cassandra-config) for detailed steps.", "guide": "Apigee"}
