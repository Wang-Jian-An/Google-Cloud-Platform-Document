Check this page for announcements about new and changed features and related product information.\n", "content": "## January 2024\n- **Feature** : you can now transition to Google Cloud NetApp Volumes using the Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud user interface. For more information, see [Transition to Google Cloud NetApp Volumes](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/transition-to-netapp-volumes) .## August 2023\n- **Update** : [Google Cloud NetApp Volumes](/netapp/volumes/docs/discover/overview) is now available for purchase. NetApp Volumes is a first-party, fully managed and integrated data storage service provided by Google Cloud, whereas NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud is a third-party offering of NetApp services in Google Cloud. You can continue to use NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud in existing projects.\n- **Feature** : A new replication pair between `us-central1` (Iowa) to `northamerica-northeast1` (Montreal) is now available. For more information, see [Requirements and considerations for volume replication].\n- NetApp has upgraded NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud to support Netlogon RPC Sealing, as detailed in [CVE-2022-38023](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-38023) .For more information, see [KB021130: How to manage the Netlogon protocol changes related to CVE-2022-38023](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5021130-how-to-manage-the-netlogon-protocol-changes-related-to-cve-2022-38023-46ea3067-3989-4d40-963c-680fd9e8ee25) .## April 2023\n- **Update** : As a response to Microsoft vulnerability [CVE-2022-38023](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-38023) , Windows server updates released on or after April 11, 2023 begin support for Netlogon RPC sealing. This may impact Active Directory domain controller connections used for Cloud Volumes Service. NetApp intends to upgrade the service to support RPC sealing by June 13, 2023. If you install the update and enable enforcement mode to require sealing, your data access to Cloud Volumes Service volumes may be affected. If you set Windows domain controllers to require sealing, then your Active Directory connection no longer authenticates users of your SMB volumes and NFS volumes using LDAP extended groups. Additionally, data access using these volumes stops.For more information on the updates, see [KB5021130: How to manage the Netlogon protocol changes related to CVE-2022-38023](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5021130-how-to-manage-the-netlogon-protocol-changes-related-to-cve-2022-38023-46ea3067-3989-4d40-963c-680fd9e8ee25) and for information on the effects of the update, see the Cloud Volumes Service FAQ [How do the Netlogon protocol changes in the April 2023 Windows update affect Cloud Volumes Service?](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/faqs-netapp#how_do_the_netlogon_protocol_changes_in_the_april_2023_windows_update_affect_cloud_volumes_service) .\n- **Update** : Cloud Volumes Service documentation now offers a new page now with information about how to achieve high application resilience using NAS protocols.
