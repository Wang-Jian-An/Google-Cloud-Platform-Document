Use this document for reference when constructing [LogQL](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/) (Log Query Language) expressions to search for audit logs stored in the monitoring instance of your project. For information on how to query logs in the monitoring instance, see [Query and view logs](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/platform/pa-user/query-and-view-logs) in the Administrative guide.\nThe information about audit log entries is organized in the following two sections:\n- [Audited components:](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/platform-application/pa-ao-operations/audited-components) This section contains a list of the meaningful audit log fields and examples for use in queries of GDCH components that audit operations. You can search for logs from these components using LogQL queries in the monitoring instance.\n- [Audit log sources:](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/platform-application/pa-ao-operations/audit-log-sources) This section contains the total JSON representation and a description of the fields generated by the original resources that capture audit logs.\nFor information about the logging processes in GDCH, see the [Collect and query logs](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/platform/pa-user/logging-overview) section in the Administrative guide", "content": ".", "guide": "Documentation"}
