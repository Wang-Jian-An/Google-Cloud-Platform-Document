Tasks that are already scheduled continue running until they are completed.\n- **Fail slow** ( `failure_policy = 'slow'` ): Choose this configuration if you want the pipeline to continue to run even after a task fails. The pipeline continues to run until all tasks have been executed. **Note:** If you don't specify the `failure_policy` parameter for a pipeline, the failure policy configuration is set to `slow` , by default.\nUse the following code sample to configure the failure policy for a pipeline using the Vertex AI SDK for Python:\n```\njob = aiplatform.PipelineJob(display_name = 'DISPLAY_NAME',\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0template_path = 'COMPILED_PIPELINE_PATH',\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0pipeline_root = 'PIPELINE_ROOT',\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0project = 'PROJECT_ID',\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0location = 'LOCATION',\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0failure_policy = 'FAILURE_POLICY')\n```\nReplace the following:\n- : The name of the pipeline, this will show up in the Google Cloud console.\n- : The path to your compiled pipeline YAML file. It can be a local path or a Google Cloud Storage URI.\n- : Specify a Cloud Storage URI that your pipelines service account can access. The artifacts of your pipeline runs are stored within the pipeline root.\n- : The Google Cloud project that this pipeline runs in.\n- : The region that the pipeline runs in. For more information about the regions that Vertex AI Pipelines is available in, see the [Vertex AI locations guide](/vertex-ai/docs/general/locations#feature-availability) . If you don't set this parameter, the default location set in `aiplatform.init` is used.\n- : Specify the failure policy for the entire pipeline. The following configurations are available:- To configure the pipeline to fail after one task fails, enter `fast` .\n- To configure the pipeline to continue scheduling tasks after one task fails, enter `slow` .\nIf you don't set this parameter, the failure policy configuration is set to `slow` , by default", "content": ".", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
