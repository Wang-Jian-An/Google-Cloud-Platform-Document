There is no additional storage charge by importing video files.\nThere are a few basic steps to use a Batch Video Warehouse:\n- **Upload and analyze videos** : Create a [corpus](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora) , [upload](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.assets/upload) video assets, generate video embeddings by [analyze](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.assets/analyze) the video assets. Additionally, developers can define [data schema](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.dataSchemas) and [annotations](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.assets.annotations) to enrich videos with supplementary metadata.\n- **Build and deploy search indexes** : Create an [index](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.indexes) and [deploy](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.indexEndpoints/deployIndex) the index to an [index endpoint](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.indexEndpoints) for search. A deployed index is managed by a dedicated pool of resources that scales with the size of the index.\n- **Search, browse, and update index data** : Perform semantic [search](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.indexEndpoints/searchIndexEndpoint) for relevant video partitions on a deployed index with text queries, images, or filter criteria on the annotation metadata. Users can also browse the corpus or index contents through [ListAssets](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.assets/list) and [ViewIndexedAssets](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.indexes/viewAssets) respectively. Batch Video Warehouse provides two ways for updating video assets in the index:- **Incremental update** : Use the [IndexAsset](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.assets) or [RemoveIndexAsset](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.assets/removeIndex) APIs to update one video at a time. This method leads to limited throughput, but low update latency.\n- **Batch update** : Use the [UpdateIndex](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.indexes/patch) API with the [asset_filter](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.indexes) parameter to fully rebuild the index. This way is preferred when you have a large number of videos to add or remove from the index.\n", "content": "## What's next\nStart onboarding with the demo [colab](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/community/vision/video_warehouse_sdk.ipynb) .", "guide": "Vertex AI Vision"}
