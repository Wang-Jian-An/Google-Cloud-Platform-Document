The region determines where your warehouse's underlying elements, such as assets, data schemas, and annotations, are stored.\n## Supported regions\nThe following regions are currently supported:\n- `europe-west4`\n- `us-central1`\nBatch video and image warehouses are supported only in `us-central1` .\n**Limitation** : Your data for a regionalized resource may not be physically located in the region that you specified when you created the resource. If you have regulatory or compliance requirements mandating your data is stored in a specific region, do not use Vertex AI Vision.While Google [Data Residency](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/meet-data-residency-requirements-with-google-cloud) requirements do not apply to all Vertex AI Vision regionalized resources, we deploy those resources in regions that provide high availability and fault tolerance. They may even be replicated to other regions for redundancy and disaster recovery.\n### Regionalized endpoints\nRequests must be directed at the regionalized endpoint that matches with the corresponding `location_id` shown below:\n- `us-central1`:`https://warehouse-visionai.googleapis.com/v1`\n- `europe-west4`:`https://europe-west4-warehouse-visionai.googleapis.com/v1`\n**Caution** : Requests sent with mismatching `location-id` and regionalized endpoint return an error.", "guide": "Vertex AI Vision"}
