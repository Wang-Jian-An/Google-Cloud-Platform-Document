To discard modifications, click the **Discard changes** button. To save changes, select **Update the application** . To apply these local changes to the application, undeploy the current application, then redeploy it.\n## List apps\nTo list all apps in a project, send a GET request by using the [projects.locations.applications.list](/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.applications/list) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Your Google Cloud [project ID or project number](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) .\n- : The [region](/about/locations) where you are using Vertex AI Vision. For example:`us-central1`,`europe-west4`. See [available regions](/vision-ai/docs/warehouse-supported-regions) .\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://visionai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/applications\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X GET \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ \"https://visionai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/applications\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\n$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token$headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $cred\" }Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri \"https://visionai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/applications\" | Select-Object -Expand Content\n```\nYou should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"applications\": [ {\n  \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/applications/test-application-1\",\n  \"createTime\": \"2022-03-01T20:04:12.558371402Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2022-03-01T20:07:21.589713094Z\",\n  \"displayName\": \"Test Application 1\",\n  \"runtimeInfo\": {\n  \"deployTime\": \"2022-03-01T20:07:21.460654Z\"\n  }\n  \"state\": \"DEPLOYED\"\n },\n {\n  \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/applications/test-application-2\",\n  \"createTime\": \"2022-03-01T20:04:12.558371402Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2022-03-01T20:07:21.589713094Z\",\n  \"displayName\": \"Test Application 2\",\n  \"runtimeInfo\": {\n  \"deployTime\": \"2022-03-01T20:07:21.460654Z\"\n  }\n  \"state\": \"DEPLOYED\"\n },\n ]\n}\n```\n## What's next\n- Learn how to read app input data from an ingestion stream or analyzed model output data in [Read stream data](/vision-ai/docs/read-stream) .", "guide": "Vertex AI Vision"}
