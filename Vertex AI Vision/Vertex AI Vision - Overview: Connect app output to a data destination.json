Using a Vision Warehouse allows you to specify annotations on whole or partial video clips.For more information about sending app output data to a Vision Warehouse, see [Connect and store data to a warehouse](/vision-ai/docs/connect-warehouse) . \n- **BigQuery** : Store data in BigQuery to use its offline analytics capabilities. Using BigQuery allows you to query streaming data, access and share analytical insights, create reports and dashboards, and export BigQuery ML models for online prediction.For more information about sending app output data to BigQuery, see [Connect and store data to BigQuery](/vision-ai/docs/connect-bigquery) . \n- **Live stream data** : If you want more granular control to act on real-time analytics, you can receive the live output from your app. For example, you can write code that uses live occupancy count data to programmatically change staffing allocation.For more information about directly streaming app output data, see [Enable live stream output](/vision-ai/docs/enable-stream-output) ", "content": ".", "guide": "Vertex AI Vision"}
