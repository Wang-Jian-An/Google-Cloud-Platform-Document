With Image Warehouse, you can:\n- Store images in a secure and scalable manner.\n- Manage annotations on images.\n- Build indexes from images and annotations for similarity matching.\n- Perform image similarity search with image or text query.\n- Search images with criteria on annotations.\nThe Image Warehouse API is powered by a Google AI multimodal embedding model that turns images (and text query) into a numerical feature space representation. This allows the API to achieve state-of-the-art results in image similarity search.\n", "content": "## Image Warehouse journey\nStart onboarding with this demo [colab](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/community/vision/image_warehouse_sdk.ipynb)\n- Create a corpus of image type.\n- Optionally create data schema if managing annotations is needed.\n- Import image assets and optionally annotations into the corpus. We will make copy of the images to store in warehouse. The corresponding storage [Pricing](/vision-ai/pricing) .\n- Perform AnalyzeCorpus to generate embedding signals from the images.\n- Create index from corpus.\n- Create index endpoint and deploy index to this index endpoint.\n- Perform search with either image or text query on this index endpoint. The Search will match against all the data contained in the deployed Index on this index endpoint.\n- Optional: Specify criteria in the search query, which will be used to match against the annotations in the index data. Only exact match is support in criteria matching.", "guide": "Vertex AI Vision"}
