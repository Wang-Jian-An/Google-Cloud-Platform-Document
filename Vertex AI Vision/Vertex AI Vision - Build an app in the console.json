Additionally, in Vertex AI Vision, an app graph must have at least two nodes: a video source node (stream), and one more node (a processing model or output destination).\n### Create an empty appBefore you can populate the app graph, you must first create an empty app.\nCreate an app in the Google Cloud console.- Open the **Applications** tab of the Vertex AI Vision dashboard. [Go to the Applications tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/vision-ai/applications) \n- Click the add **Create** button.\n- Enter `quickstart-app` as the app name and choose your region.\n- Click **Create** .### Add app component nodesAfter you have created the empty application, you can then add the three nodes to the app graph: the **ingestion node** that can receive stream data, the **processing node** that performs a computer image task on data, and a **datadestination node** , a warehouse storage destination in this example.\nAdd component nodes to your app in the console.- Open the **Applications** tab of the Vertex AI Vision dashboard. [Go to the Applications tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/vision-ai/applications) \n- In the `quickstart-app` line, select schema **View graph** . This takes you to the graph visualization of the processing pipeline.\n **Add a data ingestion node** - To add an input stream node, select the **Streams** option in the **Connectors** section of the side menu.\n- In the **Source** section of the **Stream** menu that opens, select add **Add streams** .\n- In the **Add streams** menu, choose radio_button_checked **Register newstreams** and add `quickstart-stream` as the stream name.\n- To add the stream to the app graph, click **Add streams** .\n **Add a data processing node** - To add the object detector model node, select the **Object detector** option in the **Pre-trained models** section of the side menu.\n **Add a data storage node** - To add the output destination (storage) node, select the **Vertex AI Vision's Media Warehouse** option in the **Connectors** section of the side menu.\n- In the **Vertex AI Vision's Media Warehouse** menu, click **Connect warehouse** .\n- In the **Connect warehouse** menu, select radio_button_checked **Create newwarehouse** . Name the warehouse `quickstart-warehouse` , and leave the TTL duration at 14 days.\n- Click the **Create** button to add the warehouse.\n## Deploy your app for use\nAfter you have built your end-to-end app with all the necessary components, the last step to using the app is to deploy it.\n- Open the **Applications** tab of the Vertex AI Vision dashboard. [Go to the Applications tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/vision-ai/applications) \n- Select **View graph** next to the `quickstart-app` app in the list.\n- From the application graph builder page, click the play_arrow **Deploy** button.\n- In the following confirmation dialog, select **Deploy** .The deploy operation might take several minutes to complete. After deployment finishes, green check marks appear next to the nodes. \nCongratulations! You've just created and deployed your first Vertex AI Vision app. Creating and deploying an app are the first steps in ingesting and using processed media data with Vertex AI Vision.## Clean upTo avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this quickstart, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and delete the individual resources.\n## What's next\n- Read [Set up a project and a development environment](/vision-ai/docs/cloud-environment) before you use the command line tools.\n- Learn how to [ingest data](/vision-ai/docs/create-manage-streams#ingest-videos) into your new app and read about other components you can add in [Build an app](/vision-ai/docs/build-app) .\n- Learn about other output storage and processing options in [Connect app output to a data destination ](/vision-ai/docs/connect-data-destination) .\n- Read about how to [Search Warehouse data in the console](/vision-ai/docs/search-streaming-warehouse) .\n- Read more about [Responsible AI practices](https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/) .", "guide": "Vertex AI Vision"}
