The region determines where your app's underlying elements, such as inputs, models, and warehouses, are stored.\n", "content": "## All resources in the same region\nAfter you choose a region, resources you select and those you create in the App Studio remain there. This includes inputs, models, warehouses, and any other resources that your app uses.\nThe region you select is always highlighted in our guides. This ensures that you're aware of the region your resources are stored in, and you can make an informed decision about where to create your app.\n## Supported regions\nThe following regions are currently supported:\n- `us-central1`\n- `europe-west4`\n**Limitation** : Your data for a regionalized resource may not be physically located in the region that you specified when you created the resource. If you have regulatory or compliance requirements mandating your data is stored in a specific region, do not use Vertex AI Vision.While Google [Data Residency](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/meet-data-residency-requirements-with-google-cloud) requirements do not apply to all Vertex AI Vision regionalized resources, we deploy those resources in regions that provide high availability and fault tolerance. They may even be replicated to other regions for redundancy and disaster recovery.\n## How to choose a region\nTo choose a region during app creation, follow these steps:\n- Open the **Applications** tab of the Vertex AI Vision dashboard. [Go to the Applications tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/vision-ai/applications) \n- In the **Region** drop-down, select the region where you want to create your app.\n- Click **Create** .## What's next\n- Read instructions about how to begin data ingestion from an app's input stream in [Create and manage streams](/vision-ai/docs/create-manage-streams#ingest-videos) .\n- Learn how to list apps and view a deployed app's instances in [Managing applications](/vision-ai/docs/manage-app) .\n- Learn how to read app input data from an ingestion stream or analyzed model output data in [Read stream data](/vision-ai/docs/read-stream) .", "guide": "Vertex AI Vision"}
