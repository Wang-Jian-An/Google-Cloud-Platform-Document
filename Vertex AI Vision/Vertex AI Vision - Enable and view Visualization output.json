When you deploy, you have the option to enable visualization.\n- Open the **Applications** tab of the Vertex AI Vision dashboard. [Go to the Applications tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/vision-ai/applications) \n- Find your application from the list and, next to it, select **View app** .\n- From the application graph builder page, click **Deploy** .\n- In the **Deploy application** menu that opens, select any other options that apply and check_box **Enable visualization** .\n- Choose the input you want to visualize from the drop-down menu below the checkbox option.\n- Click **Deploy** .After deployment, green check marks appear next to the nodes.## View output visualization\nAfter an app has been deployed for some minutes, you can access a visualization of the selected input.\n- Open the **Applications** tab of the Vertex AI Vision dashboard. [Go to the Applications tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/vision-ai/applications) \n- Find your application from the list and, next to it, select **View app** .\n- From the application graph builder page, click insert_chart_outlined **View Output Visualization** .You're then prompted to select the input and processor to visualize.\n- Select **View** to be directed to a stream page and view the visualization stream.## What's next\n- Read instructions about how to begin data ingestion from an app's input stream in [Create and manage streams](/vision-ai/docs/create-manage-streams#ingest-videos) .\n- Learn how to list apps and view a deployed app's instances in [Managing applications](/vision-ai/docs/manage-app) .\n- Learn how to read app input data from an ingestion stream or analyzed model output data in [Read stream data](/vision-ai/docs/read-stream) .", "guide": "Vertex AI Vision"}
