When you deploy you have the option to enable monitoring.\n- Open the **Applications** tab of the Vertex AI Vision dashboard. [Go to the Applications tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/vision-ai/applications) \n- Select **View app** next to the name of your application from the list.\n- From the application graph builder page click the **Deploy** button.\n- In the **Deploy application** menu that opens, select any other options and select check_box **Enable monitoring for this application** .\n- Click **Deploy** .After deployment completes there will be green check marks next to the nodes.## View app monitoring metrics\nAfter an app has been deployed for several minutes, you can access some app metrics, such as graphs indicating the request counts made to various external services (such as BigQuery or Cloud Functions) from various models.\n- Open the **Applications** tab of the Vertex AI Vision dashboard. [Go to the Applications tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/vision-ai/applications) \n- Select **View app** next to the name of your application from the list.\n- From the application graph builder page click the insert_chart_outlined **View details** button.In this view you can see metrics, such as app request count and uptime.\n- For a more detailed view, click the **Open Metrics Explorer** button.\n- To view a specific metric, click **Select a metric** and choose the metric.## What's next\n- Read instructions about how to begin data ingestion from an app's input stream in [Create and manage streams](/vision-ai/docs/create-manage-streams#ingest-videos) .\n- Learn how to list apps and view a deployed app's instances in [Managing applications](/vision-ai/docs/manage-app) .\n- Learn how to read app input data from an ingestion stream or analyzed model output data in [Read stream data](/vision-ai/docs/read-stream) .", "guide": "Vertex AI Vision"}
