Google provides no service-level agreements (SLA) or technical support commitments for Preview features. For more information, see GDCH's [feature stages](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/resources/feature-stages) .\nIf you want to delete an online prediction model and all the resources associated with it, perform the following steps:\n- Delete the `DeployedModel` custom resource (CR) associated with your model on the Prediction user cluster:```\nkubectl --kubeconfig PREDICTION_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete -f DEPLOYED_MODEL_NAME.yaml\n```Replace the following:- ``: the path to the kubeconfig file in the Prediction user cluster.\n- ``: the name of the`DeployedModel`definition file.\n- Edit the `Endpoint` CR in one of the following ways:- If the endpoint that the `DeployedModel` uses doesn't host other models, delete the `Endpoint` CR on the Prediction user cluster:```\nkubectl --kubeconfig PREDICTION_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete -f ENDPOINT_NAME.yaml\n```Replace `` with the name of the `Endpoint` definition file.\n- If the endpoint that the `DeployedModel` uses hosts other models, perform the following steps:- Update the `Endpoint` CR on the Prediction user cluster:```\nkubectl --kubeconfig PREDICTION_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG edit -f ENDPOINT_NAME.yaml\n```Replace `` with the name of the `Endpoint` definition file.\n- On the YAML file, manually delete the `serviceRef` object containing the `DeployedModel` reference you deleted previously.\n- Save the changes on the YAML file.\n- Delete your model from the storage bucket.
