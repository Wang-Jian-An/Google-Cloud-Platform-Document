You can now use both Apigee Integration and Application Integration within the same Google Cloud project. [Learn more](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/using-application-integration)\nYou can download your integrations as a JSON file and save it in your local system. As a result, your entire integration is available in a file, which you can directly upload in another integration project without any modifications. Uploading an integration creates a new version of the integration in the project where the file is uploaded.\n- You can copy your integration from one project to another without much effort.\n- You can programmatically update the integration file for repetitive changes, such as renaming  of tasks or dynamically modifying variable names.", "content": "## Download an integration\nTo download an integration, perform the following steps:\n- In the [Apigee UI](https://apigee.google.com) , select your.\n- Click **Develop > Integrations** .\n- Select an existing integration.

To provision a new region, Click **Enable Region** .

To get the integration version, open the required version of the integration in the UI and copy the auto-generated unique ID string after`../integrations/integration/` `` `/`from the URL.\nFor more information, see [projects.locations.products.integrations.versions.download](/apigee/docs/reference/apis/integrations/rest/v1/projects.locations.products.integrations.versions/download) .\n### Upload integration using API\n`POST`\n```\n https://integrations.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/products/apigee/integrations/INTEGRATION_NAME/versions/INTEGRATION_VERSION}:upload\n \n```\nThe following example shows you how to upload an integration:\n```\ncurl -v -s -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n-X POST -d '{\"content\": \n \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"projects/450954726404/locations/us-east1/products/apigee/integrations/test-workflow/versions/0e90d453-5fcf-4aae-b164-2e8344d1ac11\\\",\n \\\"origin\\\":\\\"UI\\\",\n \\\"snapshotNumber\\\":\\\"3\\\",\n \\\"updateTime\\\":\\\"2022-01-06T04:26:58.137Z\\\",\n \\\"lockHolder\\\":\\\"abc@test.com\\\",\n \\\"createTime\\\":\\\"2022-01-06T04:26:42.734Z\\\",\n \\\"lastModifierEmail\\\":\\\"abc@test.com\\\",\n \\\"state\\\":\\\"DRAFT\\\",\n \\\"triggerConfigs\\\":[{\\\"label\\\":\\\"API Trigger\\\",\\\"startTasks\\\":[{\\\"taskId\\\":\\\"1\\\"}],\n \\\"properties\\\":{\\\"Trigger name\\\":\\\"rj-test-workflow_API_1\\\"},\\\"triggerType\\\":\\\"API\\\",\\\"triggerNumber\\\":\\\"1\\\",\\\"triggerId\\\":\\\"api_trigger/rj-test-workflow_API_1\\\"}],\\\"taskConfigs\\\":[{\\\"task\\\":\\\"EmailTask\\\",\\\"taskId\\\":\\\"1\\\",\\\"taskExecutionStrategy\\\":\\\"WHEN_ALL_SUCCEED\\\",\\\"displayName\\\":\\\"Send Email\\\"}]}\"}' \n \\https://integrations.googleapis.com/v1/projects/apigee-1/locations/us-east1/products/apigee/integrations/test-integration/versions:upload\n```\nFor more information about the API, see [projects.locations.products.integrations.versions.upload](/apigee/docs/reference/apis/integrations/rest/v1/projects.locations.products.integrations.versions/upload) .\n## Considerations\nWhen using the upload or download feature, consider the following points:\n- Uploading an integration creates a new version of the integration. For example, if you have  an integration by name IP-Test at version 5, and you upload an integration file in IP-Test, a new version 6 is created for the integration.\n- If you don't have an existing integration in which you can upload a file, you must first create a new integration and then upload. In this case, the new integration you create will be at version 1 and the uploaded integration  will be at version 2.\n- Details of authentication profiles configured for an integration will not be available in the downloaded file. After uploading the file, you must re-configure the authentication profiles in  the uploaded integration.", "guide": "Apigee"}
