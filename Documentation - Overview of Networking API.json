From there, you can access the discovery document at the following URL:\n```\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8001/apis/networking.gdc.goog/v1\n```\n## Example ingress cross-project traffic policy\nThe following is an example of a `ProjectNetworkPolicy` object that enables workloads in the `project-1` project to permit connections from workloads in the `project-2` project, as well as the return traffic for the same flows:\n```\napiVersion: networking.gdc.goog/v1kind: ProjectNetworkPolicymetadata:\u00a0 namespace: project-1\u00a0 name: allow-ingress-traffic-from-project-2spec:\u00a0 policyType: Ingress\u00a0 subject:\u00a0 \u00a0 subjectType: UserWorkload\u00a0 ingress:\u00a0 - from:\u00a0 \u00a0 - projects:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 matchNames:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - project-2\n```", "guide": "Documentation"}
