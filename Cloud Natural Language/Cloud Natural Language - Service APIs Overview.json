If you don't want to use our [clientlibraries](/natural-language/docs/reference/libraries) to access the Cloud Natural Language API, you have the option of writing your own client libraries that use its REST/HTTP or gRPC API surface. We recommend this approach only if your language or other needs are not met by our provided client libraries.\n", "content": "## gRPC API\nYou can generate your own gRPC client libraries in any gRPC-supported language for the Cloud Natural Language API API from its .proto service definition using these resources:\n- [Cloud Natural Language API service definition](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/cloud/language/v1/language_service.proto) \n- [gRPC documentation](http://www.grpc.io/docs/) : Everything you need to generate and use your own gRPC client code\n- [RPC API Reference](/natural-language/docs/reference/rpc) : Language-independent overview of the RPC surface## REST/HTTP API\nThere are a number of possible options for interacting with a service's REST interface. Use the following resources to help you create your own clients for the REST API:\n- [REST API Reference ](/natural-language/docs/reference/rest) \n- [ Guidelines for working with Google HTTP APIs](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/http) \n- [APIDiscovery Service](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/getting_started) : Exposes machine readable metadata about the REST/HTTP API surface, useful for creating client libraries, tools, and plugins.\n- [Directory of client samples](https://developers.google.com/discovery/libraries) built with REST/HTTP APIs and the Google API Discovery Service.", "guide": "Cloud Natural Language"}
