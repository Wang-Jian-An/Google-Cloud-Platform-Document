Providing an `EncodingType` is recommended because the API provides the beginning offsets for various outputs, such as tokens and mentions, and languages that natively use different text encodings may access offsets differently.| Enums | Enums.1                                              |\n|:--------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| NONE | If EncodingType is not specified, encoding-dependent information (such as beginOffset) will be set at -1.                     |\n| UTF8 | Encoding-dependent information (such as beginOffset) is calculated based on the UTF-8 encoding of the input. C++ and Go are examples of languages that use this encoding natively.   |\n| UTF16 | Encoding-dependent information (such as beginOffset) is calculated based on the UTF-16 encoding of the input. Java and JavaScript are examples of languages that use this encoding natively. |\n| UTF32 | Encoding-dependent information (such as beginOffset) is calculated based on the UTF-32 encoding of the input. Python is an example of a language that uses this encoding natively.   ", "content": "|", "guide": "Cloud Natural Language"}
