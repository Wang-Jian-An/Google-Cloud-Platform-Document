Each type offers different tiers of storage, as described in the following sections.\n", "content": "## Block storage\nGDCH offers secure, reliable, durable, and low-latency network-based block storage that virtual machines (VMs) and containers can access like physical disks. Block storage is located independently from GDCH VMs and containers, and can be preserved even after the VMs and containers are deleted. Block storage performance scales automatically with size, and can be resized to meet workload performance and space requirements. GDCH block storage provides the following price and performance SKUs:\n- Balanced block storage: Solid-state drive (SSD) block storage that offers balanced performance and cost for general use.## Object storage\nObject storage, also known as object-based storage, is a computer data storage architecture designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data. Unlike other architectures, it designates data as distinct units, bundled with metadata and a unique identifier that can be used to locate and access each data unit. GDCH object storage is suitable for use-cases like websites, streaming videos, and mobile apps. Data must be stored for at least 30 days.", "guide": "Documentation"}
