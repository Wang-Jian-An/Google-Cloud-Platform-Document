For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\nAll of the Apigee hybrid services that run in your Kubernetes cluster output operational log information. This log information is useful for troubleshooting and debugging. For example, if a service pod's status indicates a problem, you can look at the log files for that pod to gain insight into the issue. Apigee support may request you to provide log information to diagnose and solve a problem.\n", "content": "## About logging\nEach runtime plane service writes log data to stdout/stderr, and Kubernetes writes this data to the host filesystem. A logs collector for hybrid runs on each hybrid node. The collector is a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) (replicated once and only once per node) whose job it is to collect the written log data and export it to the [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/) application associated with your GCP account.\nThe following diagram shows the log data collection process:\n## \n Next steps\n- [Enable access logs](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.1/access-logs) \n- [View logs](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.1/logging-view)", "guide": "Apigee"}
