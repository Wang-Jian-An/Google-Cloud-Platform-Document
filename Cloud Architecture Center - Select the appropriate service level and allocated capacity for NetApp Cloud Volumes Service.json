Selecting the appropriate service level and capacity helps you meet your storage needs at the lowest cost.\n**Note:** All pricing information in this document is provided for example purposes only and is subject to change.\n", "content": "## Storage considerations\nStorage needs include two fundamental aspects:\n- The storagefor holding data.\n- The storagefor interacting with data.\nIf you consume more storage space than the capacity you selected for the volume, the following considerations apply:\n- You will be billed for the additional storage capacity that you consume at the price defined by your service level.\n- The amount of storage bandwidth available to the volume does not increase until you increase the allocated capacity size or change the service level.## Service levels\nCloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud supports three service levels for CVS-Performance service type volumes. You specify your service level when you create or modify the volume.\nThe service levels are designed for different storage capacity and storage bandwidth needs:\n- **Standard** (capacity)If you want capacity at the lowest cost, and your bandwidth needs are limited, then the Standard service level might be most appropriate for you. An example is using the volume as a file-share target.- [List price](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/costs) \n- Bandwidth: 16 KiB of bandwidth per GiB provisioned capacity\n- **Premium** (a balance of capacity and performance)If your app has a balanced need for storage capacity and bandwidth, then the Premium service level might be most appropriate for you. This level is less expensive per MiB/s than the Standard service level, and it is also less expensive per GiB of storage capacity than the Extreme service level.- [List price](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/costs) \n- Bandwidth: 64 KiB of bandwidth per GiB provisioned capacity\n- **Extreme** (performance)The Extreme service level is least expensive in terms of storage bandwidth. If your app demands storage bandwidth without the associated demand for lots of storage capacity, then the Extreme service level might be most appropriate for you.- [List price](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/costs) \n- Bandwidth: 128 KiB of bandwidth per GiB provisioned capacity\n## Allocated capacity\nYou specify your allocated capacity for the volume when you [create or modify the volume](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/how-to) .\nWhile you would select your service level based on your general, high-level business needs, you should select your allocated capacity size based on the needs of apps, for example:\n- How much storage space the apps need.\n- How much storage bandwidth per second the apps or the users require.\nAllocated capacity is specified in GiBs. A volume's allocated capacity can be set within the range of 1024 GiB to 102,400 GiB (equivalent to 100 TiBs).\n## Bandwidth\nThe combination of both the service level and the allocated capacity you select determines the maximum bandwidth for the volume.\nIf your apps or users need more bandwidth than your selections, you can change the service level or increase the allocated capacity. The changes do not disrupt data access.\n## Select the service level and the allocated capacity\nTo select the most appropriate service level and allocated capacity for your needs, you need to know how much capacity and bandwidth you require at the peak or the edge.\n### Cost comparison for service levels and allocated capacity\nThe following table compares the cost for different service levels and allocated capacity sizes. In the table, the first column indicates the capacity, and the other columns define the maximum read throughput in MiB/s available at each capacity point and its cost per month.\n| Capacity | Standard

selecting the appropriate service level.\nFor example, your app requires 25 TiB of capacity and 100 MiB/s of bandwidth. At 25 TiB of capacity, the Standard service level would provide 400 MiB/s of bandwidth at a cost of $5,120 per month, making Standard the most suitable service level in this case.\n| Capacity | Standard | Standard.1 | Premium | Premium.1 | Extreme | Extreme.1 |\n|:-----------|:-----------|:-------------|:----------|:------------|:----------|:------------|\n| TiB  | MiB/s  | Cost   | MiB/s  | Cost  | MiB/s  | Cost  |\n| 25   | 400  | $5,120  | 1600  | $7,680  | 3200  | $10,240  |\nFor example, your app requires 12 TiB of capacity and 800 MiB/s of peak bandwidth. Although the Extreme service level can meet the demands of the app at the 12 TiB mark, it is more cost-effective to select 13 TiB at the Premium service level.\n| Capacity | Standard | Standard.1 | Premium | Premium.1 | Extreme | Extreme.1 |\n|:-----------|:-----------|:-------------|:----------|:------------|:----------|:------------|\n| TiB  | MiB/s  | Cost   | MiB/s  | Cost  | MiB/s  | Cost  |\n| 12   | 192  | $2,458  | 768  | $3,686  | 1536  | $4,915  |\n| 13   | 208  | $2,662  | 832  | $3,994  | 1664  | $5,325  |", "guide": "Cloud Architecture Center"}
