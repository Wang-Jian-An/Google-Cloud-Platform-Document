These services include Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Translation, and Speech-to-Text.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\nBefore downloading the tar file and extracting the client libraries, follow these instructions:\n- If you haven't downloaded the `gdcloud` CLI, see [Download the gdcloud CLI](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/resources/gdcloud-download) .\n- Sign in to your environment.```\ngdcloud set context && gdcloud auth login YOURCREDENTIAL\n```\n- Create a service account. In this example, the service account is named .```\ngdcloud iam service-account create sa-foo\n```\n- Bind the service account to the role `cloud-ai-viewer` , which grants permissions to access the Vertex AI services.```\ngdcloud iam service-account role-binding sa-foo --role=cloudai-viewer\n```\n- Generate authentication credentials for the service account.```\ngdcloud iam service-account get-cred sa-foo\n```\n- Verify that you have Python version 3.7 installed.## Installation\nAfter completing the [prerequisites](#before-you-begin) , follow these steps to download the tar file, and use the tar file to install the client libraries:\n- Download the client library you want to install. To learn which client libraries are available, see [Client libraries](#CLIENTLIB) .\n- Extract the library file.```\ntar -zxf centos-google-cloud-speech-2.15.0.tar.gz\n```\n- Use the `pip install` command to install the libraries into GDCH.```\npip install -r google-cloud-<LIB>/requirements.txt --no-index --find-links google-cloud-<LIB>\n```\n- Create the following Python script to import the Translation client library:```\nfrom google.cloud import translatetranslate_client = translate.Client(\u00a0client_options={\"API_ENDPOINT\": \"https://foo-translation.googleapis.com\"})result = translate_client.translate(text, target_language=\"ru\")\n```\n- Save the Python script as `translation-service.py` .\n- Run the Python script.```\npython translation-service.py\n```## How to run client libraries\nThere are two ways to run a client library:\n- Follow the steps in the [Installation](#INSTALLSTEPS) section.\n- Use your notebook to import the library. If you need to set up a notebook, see [Vertex AI Workbench](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/application/ao-user/vertex-ai-workbench) .\n### Client libraries\nCentOS and Ubuntu OS support is provided for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Translation, and Speech-to-Text client libraries, which GDCH hosts.\nThe file names are in the following format: `<OS>-google-cloud-<lib>-<version_number>.tar.gz` .\n- centos-google-cloud-speech-2.15.0.tar.gz\n- centos-google-cloud-translate-3.8.0.tar.gz\n- centos-google-cloud-vision-3.0.0.tar.gz\n- ubuntu-google-cloud-speech-2.15.0.tar.gz\n- ubuntu-google-cloud-translate-3.8.0.tar.gz\n- ubuntu-google-cloud-vision-3.0.0.tar.gz", "guide": "Documentation"}
