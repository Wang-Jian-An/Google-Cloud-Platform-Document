You can now use both Apigee Integration and Application Integration within the same Google Cloud project. [Learn more](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/using-application-integration)\nError catcher is one of the error handling methods in Apigee Integration that helps you handle task and event failures encountered during the execution of an integration.\nError catchers work very similar to a sub integration flow within your main integration. Each error catcher can be invoked using a trigger, called the [Error catcher](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/configure-error-catcher-trigger) trigger, to run the set of configured [integration tasks](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/how-to#configure-integration-tasks) customized to handle the error.\n**Note:** Error catchers can't be nested. You cannot define an error catcher that in turn calls another error catcher using a different Error catcher trigger in your integration.\nFor information about how to define and use an error catcher in your integration, see [Create the error catcher logic](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/configure-error-catcher-trigger#logic) ", "content": ".", "guide": "Apigee"}
