For example, on Compute Engine, you can use labels to group VMs in categories such as production, staging, or development so that you can search for resources that belong to each development stage.\nAfter adding labels to your resources, you can take advantage of the [nestedfiltering](#filter) feature to perform more precise searches for your resources using labels.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\n- Read the [persistent disks](/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk) documentation.\n- Read the [images](/compute/docs/images) documentation.\n- If you haven't already, set up authentication. [Authentication](/compute/docs/authentication) is the process by which your identity is verified for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to Compute Engine as follows.Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:\nWhen you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and   APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:```\ngcloud init\n``` **Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI  previously, make sure you have the latest version by running`gcloud components  update`.\n- [ Set a default region and zone](/compute/docs/gcloud-compute#set_default_zone_and_region_in_your_local_client) .\nTo use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:\n- ```\ngcloud init\n```## What are labels?\nA label is a key-value pair that you can assign to Google Cloud instances. They help you organize these resources and manage your costs at scale, with the granularity you need. You can attach a label to each resource, then filter the resources based on their labels. Information about labels is forwarded to the billing system that lets you break down your billed charges by label. With built-in [billing reports](/billing/docs/how-to/reports) , you can filter and group costs by resource labels. You can also use labels to query [billing data exports](/billing/docs/how-to/bq-examples) .\n## Requirements for labels\nThe labels applied to a resource must meet the following requirements:\n- Each resource can have up to 64 labels.\n- Each label must be a key-value pair.\n- Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 63 characters, and cannot be empty. Values can be empty, and have a maximum length of 63 characters.\n- Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international characters are allowed. Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character.\n- The key portion of a label must be unique within a single resource. However, you can use the same key with multiple resources.\nThese limits apply to the key and value for each label, and to the individual Google Cloud resources that have labels. There is no limit on how many labels you can apply across all resources within a project.\n## Common uses of labels\nHere are some common use cases for labels:\n- **Team or cost center labels** : Add labels based on team or cost center to distinguish instances owned by different teams (for example, `team:research` and `team:analytics` ). You can use this type of label for cost accounting or budgeting.\n- **Component labels** : For example, `component:redis` , `component:frontend` , `component:ingest` , and `component:dashboard` .\n- **Environment or stage labels** : For example, `environment:production` and `environment:test` .\n- **State labels** : For example, `state:active` , `state:readytodelete` , and `state:archive` .\n- **Ownership labels** : Used to identify the teams that are responsible for operations, for example: `team:shopping-cart` .- **Virtual machine labels** : A label can be attached to a virtual machine. Virtual machine tags that you defined in the past appear as a label without a value.**Note:** Don't include sensitive information in labels, including personally identifiable information, such as an individual's name or title. Labels are not designed to handle sensitive information.\nWe don't recommend creating large numbers of unique labels, such as for timestamps or individual values for every API call. The problem with this approach is that when the values change frequently or with keys that clutter the catalog, this makes it difficult to effectively filter and report on resources.\n## Labels and tags\nLabels can be used as queryable annotations for resources, but can't be used to set conditions on policies. Tags provide a way to conditionally allow or deny policies based on whether a resource has a specific tag, by providing fine-grained control over policies. For more information, see the [Tags overview](/resource-manager/docs/tags/tags-overview) .\n## Use labels on Compute Engine\nYou can apply labels to the following Compute Engine resources:\n- Virtual machine (VM) instances\n- Images\n- Persistent disks\n- Persistent disk snapshots\nYou can also use labels on related Google Cloud components such as the following:\n- [Cloud Storage buckets](/storage/docs/using-bucket-labels) \n- Networking resources:- Forwarding rules\n- VPN tunnels ( [Preview](/products#product-launch-stages) )\n- Static external IP addresses ( [Preview](/products#product-launch-stages) )For example, you can add the following labels as key-value pairs to your resources:\n```\n{\n \"labels\": {\n \"vmrole\": \"webserver\",\n \"environment\": \"production\",\n \"location\": \"west\",...\n }\n }\n```\n## Create resources with labels\nWhen creating a new resource, you can apply labels to the resource.\n**Note:** You can't add labels to forwarding rules, static external IP addresses, and VPN tunnels when creating these resources. You can only add labels to these networking resources when you're updating the resource. For instructions on adding labels during an update, see [Add or update labels to existing resources](#add_or_update_labels_to_existing_resources) in this document.\n- Go to the resource page that you want to create.- For VM instances, go to [Create an instance](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) .\n- For disks, go to [Create a disk](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/disks) .\n- For snapshots, go to [Create a snapshot](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/snapshots) .\n- For images, go to [Create an image](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/image) .\n- Under **Labels** , click add **Add label** .\n- Continue with the creation process.\nTo add a label, use the `create` sub-command with the `--labels` flag.

Your results include any partial matches.For example, to show only resources with the label `env:dev` , you can enter any of the following:- Enter the key:`env`\n- Enter the value:`dev`\n- Enter the key-value pair:`env:dev`\nTo filter based on labels, use the `list` sub-command of the following resources with the `--filter` flag:- For VM instances, use the [gcloud compute instances listcommand](/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/list) .\n- For snapshots, use the [gcloud compute snapshots listcommand](/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/snapshots/list) .\n- For images, use the [gcloud compute images listcommand](/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/images/list) .\n- For disks, use the [gcloud compute disks listcommand](/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/disks/list) .\n- For forwarding rules, use the [gcloud compute forwarding-rules listcommand](/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/forwarding-rules/list) .\n- For static external IP addresses, use the [gcloud beta compute addresses listcommand](/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/addresses/list) .\n- For VPN tunnels, use the [gcloud beta compute vpn-tunnels listcommand](/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/vpn-tunnels/list) .\nThe value of `--filter` flag must be in the `labels.` `` `=` `` format. For example, if you wanted to filter on a label with `env` as the key and `dev` as the value, you can run this command:\n```\ngcloud compute instances list \\\n --filter labels.env=dev\n```\nFor more information about the filter syntax in the gcloud CLI, see the [gcloud topic filters documentation](/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/filters) .\nTo filter resources, make a `GET` request to the `list` method of the following resources and include the filter field:- For VM instances, use the [instances.list() method](/compute/docs/reference/latest/instances/list) .\n- For snapshots, use the [snapshots.list() method](/compute/docs/reference/latest/snapshots/list) .\n- For images, use the [images.list() method](/compute/docs/reference/latest/images/list) .\n- For disks, use the [disks.list() method](/compute/docs/reference/latest/disks/list) .\n- For forwarding rules, use the [forwardingRules.list() method](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/forwardingRules/list) .\n- For regional static external IP addresses, use the [beta addresses.list() method](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/addresses/list) .\n- For global static external IP addresses, use the [beta globalAddresses.list() method](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/globalAddresses/list) .\n- For VPN tunnels, use the [beta vpnTunnels.list() method](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/vpnTunnels/list) .\nFor example, to list all the VMs in the project `myproject` and zone `us-central1-a` with a label that has a key-value pair of `env:dev` , set the filter field to `labels.env:dev` in your `list` request. If you include the filter field as a query string parameter, use a URL-encoded parameter value, `filter=labels.env%3Adev` :\n```\nGET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/zones/us-central1-a/instances?filter=labels.env%3Adev\n```\nFor more information, read the [filter documentation](/compute/docs/reference/latest/instances/list#filter) in the Compute Engine API reference.\n## Relationship between VM labels and network tags\nIn the past, labels and tags were related. For example, if you added a `webserver:test` label to a VM, Compute Engine automatically added a `webserver` tag to the VM.\nNow, labels and tags are separate. If you create a label on a VM, Compute Engine does not create a tag for the VM. If you need to create a tag on a VM, you must create the tag manually.\nTo learn how to create tags, see [Network tags](/compute/docs/vpc/add-remove-network-tags) .\n## What's next\n- Learn how to add [network tags](/compute/docs/vpc/add-remove-network-tags) .\n- Learn about [filtering](/compute/docs/reference/latest/instances/list#filter) .", "guide": "Compute Engine"}
