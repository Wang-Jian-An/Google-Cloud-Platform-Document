Follow these steps to avoid incurring unexpected charges from some of the resources.\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Set up your project and environment.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl) \n- [Create an image classification dataset, and import images.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/dataset) \n- [Train an AutoML image classification model.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/training) \n- [Evaluate and analyze model performance.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/error-analysis) \n- [Deploy a model to an endpoint, and send a prediction.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/deploy-predict) \n- Clean up your project.\nEach page assumes that you have already performed the instructions from the previous pages of the tutorial.\n", "content": "## Delete Vertex AI resources\nThis section describes how to undeploy your model, and then delete the following project resources: endpoint, model, dataset, and Cloud Storage bucket.\n### Undeploy your model\nBefore you can delete your model and endpoint, you must undeploy the model.\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Training** page. [Go to the Training page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/training) \n- Select your trained AutoML model. This takes you to the **Evaluate** tab.\n- Click the **Deploy & test** tab.\n- Find your model. On your model's row, click the three vertical dots more_vert , then click **Undeploy model** .\n- In **Undeploy model** , click **Confirm** .\n### Delete your endpoint\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Endpoints** page. [Go to the Endpoints page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/endpoints) \n- Find your endpoint, `hello_automl_image` . On that row, click the three vertical dots more_vert , then click **Remove endpoint** .\n- In **Remove endpoint** , click **Confirm** .\n### Delete your model\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Models** page. [Go to the Models page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/models) \n- Find your model. On that row, click the three vertical dots more_vert , then click **Deletemodel** .\n- In **Delete model and all of its associated versions** , click **Delete** .\n### Delete your dataset\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Datasets** page. [Go to the Datasets page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/datasets) \n- Find your dataset. On that row, click the three vertical dots more_vert , then click **Deletedataset** .\n- In **Delete dataset** , click **Delete** .## Clean up your Cloud Shell session\nCloud Shell incurs no charges, and it [automatically deletes your homedisk after a period of inactivity](/shell/docs/limitations) .\n## Delete your Cloud Storage bucket\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage **Buckets** page. [Go to Buckets](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) \n- Click the checkbox for the bucket that you want to delete.\n- To delete the bucket,  clickdelete **Delete** , and then follow the  instructions.\n## What's next\n- To learn about additional ways to train ML models on Vertex AI, try one of the other [Vertex AI tutorials](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials) .\n- Read an [overview of how Vertex AIworks](/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
