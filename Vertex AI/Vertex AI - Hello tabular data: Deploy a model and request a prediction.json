After your model is deployed to this new endpoint, test your model by requesting a prediction.\n", "content": "## Load your model\nWhen your model finishes training, it is listed in the **Models** tab.\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Models** page. [Go to the Models page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/models) \n- From the models list, click the name of your trained model that you created previously\n- Models are organized into versions. Click model version number 1.## Evaluate your model\nThe **Evaluate** panel helps you understand how the model performed against the test set. When you are done, continue to the next part of the tutorial.\n### Evaluation metrics\n**Optional** . Hold the pointer over the `?` icons to learn about each evaluation metric.\n**Optional** . Move the confidence threshold slider to see how the precision, recall, and F1 scores are affected.\n### Confusion matrix\nThe **confusion matrix** shows how a prediction compares to the test set (ground truth).\nRecall that label \"1\" is the negative class (the customer did not sign up for a term deposit) and \"2\" is the positive class. Your model likely did a better job predicting the negative class than the positive class. Perhaps with additional training time, more data, or additional features, you could improve predictive performance for the positive class.\n### Feature importance\n**Feature importance** shows how each feature impacted model training: The higher the value, the more impactful.\nYour model probably shows that **duration** (how long the most recent communication between the bank and customer lasted, in seconds) contributed heavily to the prediction outcome.\n## Deploy your model to an endpoint\nTo test a model or make online predictions, you need to deploy it to an endpoint.\n- Open the **Deploy & Test** panel.\n- Under **Deploy your model** , click **Deploy to endpoint** .\n- Enter `Structured_AutoML_Tutorial` for the endpoint name.\n- Click **Continue** .\n- Keep the minimum compute node at `1` and don't enter a maximum.\n- Select `n1-standard-2` machine type.\n- Click **Continue** .\n- Turn off model monitoring for this endpoint.\n- Click **Deploy** . to create your endpoint and deploy your model to it.Model deployment takes around 5 minutes. When your endpoint is ready, proceed to the next part of the tutorial. **Note:** Make sure to undeploy the model later so you aren't charged for additional compute resources. We'll show you how to do that at the end of this tutorial.## Request a prediction\nNow that your model is deployed to an endpoint, you can send prediction requests. Rather than send a request through the API or gcloud, you can test your model on this page.\n- In the **Test your model** section, you'll see a **Value** column that's pre-filled. You can use those values or enter new ones.\n- At the bottom of the section, press **Predict** .For this model, a prediction result of `1` represents a negative outcome\u2014a deposit is not made at the bank. A prediction result of `2` represents a positive outcome\u2014a deposit is made at the bank.Your model will return a confidence score, which is the model's level of certainty that the selected label is the correct one. The default value probably returned a high confidence score.\n- **Optional** . Try changing **duration** to a much higher value and press Predict again.## What's next\n- To avoid incurring unexpected charges, follow the instructions in [Clean up your project](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/tabular-automl/cleanup) \n- [Learn more](/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/classification-regression/evaluate-model) about model evaluation.\n- [Learn more](/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/classification-regression/get-online-predictions) about model predictions.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
