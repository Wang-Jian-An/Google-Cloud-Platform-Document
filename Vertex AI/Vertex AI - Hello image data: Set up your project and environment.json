Then create a Cloud Storage bucket and copy image files to use for training an AutoML image classification model.\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- Set up your project and environment.\n- [Create an image classification dataset, and import images.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/dataset) \n- [Train an AutoML image classification model.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/training) \n- [Evaluate and analyze model performance.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/error-analysis) \n- [Deploy a model to an endpoint, and send a prediction.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/deploy-predict) \n- [Clean up your project.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/cleanup) \nEach page assumes that you have already performed the instructions from the previous pages of the tutorial.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\nComplete the following steps before using Vertex AI functionality.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the project selector page. [Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard) \n- Select or create a Google Cloud project. **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the  resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of  selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can  delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.\n- [Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#console) .\n- Open [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell-editor) .  Cloud Shell is an interactive shell environment  for Google Cloud that lets you manage your projects and resources from  your web browser.\n- [Go to Cloud Shell](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor) \n- In the Cloud Shell, set the current project to your Google Cloud project ID and store it in the`projectid`shell variable:```\n gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID &&\n projectid=PROJECT_ID &&\n echo $projectid\n```Replacewith your project ID. You can locate your project ID in the Google Cloud console. For more information, see [Find your project ID](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/tabular-bq-prediction/prerequisites#find-project-id) .\n- Enable the IAM, Compute Engine, Notebooks, Cloud Storage, and Vertex AI APIs:```\ngcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com \u00a0compute.googleapis.com notebooks.googleapis.com storage.googleapis.com aiplatform.googleapis.com\n```\n- Grant roles to your Google Account. Run the following command once for each of the following   IAM roles: `roles/aiplatform.user, roles/storage.admin` ```\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member=\"user:EMAIL_ADDRESS\" --role=ROLE\n```- Replace``with your project ID.\n- Replace``with your email address.\n- Replace``with each individual role.- The Vertex AI User (\n- `roles/aiplatform.user`\n- ) IAM role provides access to use all resources in Vertex AI. The\n- [Storage Admin](/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) \n- (\n- `roles/storage.admin`\n- ) role you store the document's training dataset in Cloud Storage.\n## What's next\nFollow the [next page of this tutorial](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/dataset) to use the Google Cloud console to create an image classification dataset and import images hosted in a public Cloud Storage bucket.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
