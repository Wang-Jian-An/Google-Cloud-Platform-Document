They're end-to-end tutorials that show you how to preprocess data, train, deploy, and use the models for inference.\nThere are many environments in which you can host Jupyter Notebooks. You can:\n- Download them from GitHub and run them on your local machine\n- Download them from GitHub and run them on a Jupyter or JupyterLab server in your local network\n- Run them in the cloud using a service like [Colaboratory (Colab)](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) or [Vertex AI Workbench](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/introduction) .\nRunning a Jupyter Notebook in Colab is an easy way to get started quickly.\nTo open a notebook tutorial in Colab, click the **Colab** link in the [notebook list](#notebook-list) . Colab creates a VM instance with all needed dependencies, launches the Colab environment, and loads the notebook.\nYou can also run the notebook using user-managed notebooks. When you create a user-managed notebooks instance with Vertex AI Workbench, you have full control over the hosting VM. You can specify the configuration and environment of the hosting VM.\nVertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks is [deprecated](/vertex-ai/docs/deprecations) . On January 30, 2025, support for  user-managed notebooks will end and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/migrate-to-instances) .To open a notebook tutorial in a Vertex AI Workbench instance:\n- Click the **Vertex AI Workbench** link in  the [notebook list](#notebook-list) .  The link opens the Vertex AI Workbench console.\n- In the **Deploy to notebook** screen, type a name for your new  Vertex AI Workbench instance and click **Create** .\n- In the **Ready to open notebook** dialog that appears after the instance starts,  click **Open** .\n- On the **Confirm deployment to notebook server** page, select **Confirm** .\n- Before running the notebook, select **Kernel\u00a0> Restart Kernel\n and Clear all Outputs** .", "content": "## List of notebooks\nAdd a <devsite-select> custom element and give it a unique 'id'.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
