This page provides some information about doing those things.\n", "content": "## Prepare your embeddings\nTo use Vector Search, you need to have your embeddings ready. If you already have your embeddings, skip to [Choose anendpoint](/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/setup/setup#choose-endpoint) .\nTo create your embeddings, do the following:\n- **Choose an embedding model** : There are many external embedding models available, which offer different features. Depending on your use case, choose one of the following type of model:- **Ready-to-use** : If you want to semantically match text to text or text to images by the relevance of the text or image alone. This is a standard use case, so you don't need to train or tune the model. [Generative AI on Vertex AI](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings) is a recommended option for this use case.\n- **Custom model for embeddings** : If you want to semantically match based on your own data or specific use case.\n- **Prepare your data** : Clean and preprocess your data to ensure that it is in a format that can be used by the embedding model.\n- **Train the embedding model if you use a custom model** : If you choose to use a custom embeddings model (tuning), you need to train it on your data. This can be a time-consuming process that depends on the size and complexity of your data. If you use a pretrained model from the [Model Garden](/vertex-ai/docs/start/explore-models) , then you can skip this step.\n- **Generate embeddings** : After the model is trained, use it to generate embeddings for your data.## Choose an endpoint\nAfter you have created your index, you'll deploy it to an endpoint. For more information, see [Deploy and manage public indexendpoints](/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/deploy-index-public) and [Deploy and manageindex endpoints in a VPC network](/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/deploy-index-vpc) . It is helpful to decide what kind of endpoint that you need before you create your index.\nYou can deploy your query index to one of the following:\n- **Public endpoint** : If you deploy to a public endpoint, you don't need to set up your network. Public networks have slightly higher latency, but are faster to set up and easier to maintain.\n- **Private Endpoint** : If you want to use a VPC, you must first set up networking. Vector Search supports two types of private network.- [VPC Network Peering connection](/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/setup/vpc) for reduced network latency.\n- [Private serviceconnect](/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/setup/private-service-connect) for private consumption of services across VPC networks that belong to different groups, teams, projects, or organizations.\n## What's next\nAfter you've generated your embeddings and decided where to deploy your index, the next step is to configure your index.\n- Learn how to configure [input data format and structure](/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/setup/format-structure) \n- Learn how to create a Vector Search index using [notebook tutorials](/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/notebooks) \n- Learn how to [manage indexes](/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/create-manage-index)", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
