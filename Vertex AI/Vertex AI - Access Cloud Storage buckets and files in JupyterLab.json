On January 30, 2025, support for  managed notebooks will end and the ability to create managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nThis page shows you how to mount a Cloud Storage bucket to the JupyterLab interface of your Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instance so that you can browse files that are stored in Cloud Storage. You can also open and edit files that are compatible with JupyterLab, such as text files and notebook (IPYNB) files.\n", "content": "## Overview\nVertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instances include a Cloud Storage integration that lets you mount a Cloud Storage bucket. This means you can browse the contents of the bucket and work with compatible files from within the JupyterLab interface.\nYou can access any of the Cloud Storage buckets and files that your instance has access to within the same project as your managed notebooks instance.\n**Note:** Your managed notebooks instance's access to Cloud Storage is determined by the single user or service account that you used to grant access to your instance. For example, if you granted a specific service account access to your instance, you must also grant that service account access to the Cloud Storage buckets that you want to use in JupyterLab.\n## Before you begin\nThis guide requires you to have access to at least one Cloud Storage bucket in the same project as your managed notebooks instance.\n- If you need to create a Cloud Storage bucket, see [Create buckets](/storage/docs/creating-buckets) .\n- If you haven't already, [createa managed notebooks instance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/create-instance#create) in the same project as your Cloud Storage bucket.## Open JupyterLab\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Managed notebooks** page. [Go to Managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/managed) \n- Next to your managed notebooks instance's name, click **Open JupyterLab** .Your managed notebooks instance opens JupyterLab.## Mount the Cloud Storage buckets and files\nTo mount and then access a Cloud Storage bucket, do the following:\n- In JupyterLab, make sure the folder **File Browser** tab is selected.\n- In the left sidebar, click the **Mountshared storage** button. If you don't see the button, drag the right side of the sidebar to expand the sidebar until you see the button. \n- In the **Bucket name** field, enter the Cloud Storage bucket name that you want to mount.\n- Click **Mount** .\n- Your Cloud Storage bucket appears as a folder in the **File browser** tab of the left sidebar. Double-click the folder to open it and browse the contents.## What's next\n- Learn more about [Cloud Storage](/storage/docs/introduction) .\n- Learn how to [query data in BigQueryfrom within JupyterLab](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/bigquery) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
