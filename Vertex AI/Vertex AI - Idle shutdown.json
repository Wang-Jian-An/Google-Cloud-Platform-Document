On January 30, 2025, support for  managed notebooks will end and the ability to create managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nVertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instances shut down after a specified period of inactivity by default. This page describes the idle shutdown feature and how to change the default idle shutdown settings during instance creation.\n", "content": "## Overview\nTo help manage costs, managed notebooks instances shut down after being idle for a specific time period by default. You can change the amount of time or turn this feature off.\n## Billing\nWhile your instance is shut down, there are no CPU or GPU usage charges except for scheduled executions that run during the shutdown. For more information about scheduled executions, see [Scheduled executions run while instance is shut down](#executions) on this page.\nDisk storage charges still apply while your instance is shut down.\nFor more information, see [Pricing](/vertex-ai/pricing#notebooks) .\n## Disable idle shutdown or change the default inactivity time period\nIdle shutdown is enabled and set to shut down your instance after 180 inactive minutes by default.\nYou can change these settings when you [create an instance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/create-instance) .\nTo disable idle shutdown or to change the inactivity time period on an existing instance:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Managed notebooks** page. [Go to Managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/managed) \n- Click the instance name.\n- On the **Notebook details** page, click the **Software and security** tab.\n- In the **Modify software and security configuration** section:- To disable idle shutdown, clear the check mark next to **Enable Idle Shutdown** .\n- To change the inactivity time period, in **Time of inactivity before shutdown (Minutes)** , change the number to the number of minutes of inactivity that you want. In the Google Cloud console, this setting can be set to any integer value from 10 to 1440.\n- Click **Submit** .## How idle timeout works\nYour instance shuts down when there is no kernel activity for the specified time period. For example, running a cell or new output printing to a notebook is activity that resets the idle timeout timer. CPU usage doesn't reset the idle timeout timer.\n### Scheduled executions run while instance is shut down\nIf you have scheduled an execution of a notebook file in a managed notebooks instance that is shut down, it will still run on schedule.\nFor more information, see [Run notebook files with the executor](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/executor) .\n## What's next\n- To run a notebook file on a schedule, even when your instance is shut down, [schedulean execution](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/schedule-managed-notebooks-run) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
