As a statistical model, it is faster to train than a [model based on neural networks](/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/forecasting/overview) . We recommend training a BigQuery ML ARIMA_PLUS model if you need to perform many quick iterations of model training or if you need an inexpensive baseline to measure other models against.\nLike [Prophet](/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/forecasting-prophet) , BigQuery ML ARIMA_PLUS attempts to decompose each time series into trends, seasons, and holidays, producing a forecast using the aggregation of these models' predictions. One of the many differences, however, is that BQML ARIMA+ uses ARIMA to model the trend component, while Prophet attempts to fit a curve using a piecewise logistic or linear model.\nGoogle Cloud offers a pipeline for training a BigQuery ML ARIMA_PLUS model and a pipeline for getting batch predictions from a BigQuery ML ARIMA_PLUS model. Both pipelines are instances of [Vertex AI Pipelines](/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction) from [Google Cloud Pipeline Components](/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/components-introduction) (GCPC).\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn more about [BigQuery ML ARIMA_PLUS](/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-time-series) .\n- Learn about [the service accounts used by this workflow](/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/tabular-workflows/service-accounts#arima) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
