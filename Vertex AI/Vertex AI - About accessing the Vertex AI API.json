Google Cloud offers the following public and private access options, which offer global reachability and SSL/TLS security:\n- [Public internet access](#internet) : Send traffic to`` `-aiplatform.googleapis.com`.\n- [Private Google Access for on-premises hosts](#pga) : Use the IP address subnet range`199.36.153.8/30`(private.googleapis.com) or`199.36.153.4/30`(restricted.googleapis.com) to access`` `-aiplatform.googleapis.com`.\n- [Private Service Connect endpoints for Google APIs](#psc) : Use a user-defined internal IP address such as`10.0.0.100`to access`` `-aiplatform.googleapis.com`or an assigned DNS name such as`vertexai-genai1.p.googleapis.com`.\nThe following diagram illustrates these access options.\nSome Vertex AI service producers require you to connect to their services through [private services access](/vertex-ai/docs/general/private-services-access) or through [Private Service Connect endpoints](/vertex-ai/docs/general/psc-endpoints) . These services are listed in the [Private access options for Vertex AI](/vertex-ai/docs/general/netsec-overview#private_access_options_for) table.\n", "content": "## Public internet access to the Vertex AI API\nIf your application uses a Google service listed in the [table of supported access methods for Vertex AI](/vertex-ai/docs/general/netsec-overview#support-table) , your application can access the API by performing a DNS lookup against the [service endpoint](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest#service-endpoint) ( `` `-aiplatform.googleapis.com` ), which returns publicly routable virtual IP addresses. You can use the API from any location in the world as long as you have an internet connection. However, traffic that is sent from Google Cloud resources to those IP addresses remains within Google's network.\n## Private access to the Vertex AI API\nPrivate access is an alternative to connecting to Google APIs and services over the internet. It provides higher bandwidth, reliability and consistent performance. Google Cloud supports the following options for accessing Google APIs privately through hybrid networking services such as Cloud Interconnect, Cross-Cloud Interconnect, HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect, and SD-WAN.\n### Private Google Access for on-premises hosts\n[Private Google Access for on-premises hosts](/vpc/docs/private-google-access-hybrid) provides a way for on-premises systems to connect to Google APIs and services by routing traffic through hybrid networking services.\nPrivate Google Access requires you to advertise one of the following subnet IP address ranges as a custom route advertisement by using Cloud Router:\n- `private.googleapis.com`:`199.36.153.8/30`,`2600:2d00:0002:2000::/64`\n- `restricted.googleapis.com`:`199.36.153.4/30`,`2600:2d00:0002:1000::/64`\nFor more information, see [Configure Private Google Access for on-premises hosts](/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access-hybrid) .\n### Private Service Connect endpoints for the Vertex AI API\nWith Private Service Connect, you can create private endpoints using global internal IP addresses within your VPC network. You can assign DNS names to these internal IP addresses with meaningful names like `vertexai-genai1.p.googleapis.com` and `bigtable-adsteam.p.googleapis.com` . These names and IP addresses are internal to your VPC network and any on-premises networks that are connected to it through hybrid networking services. You can control which traffic goes to which endpoint, and can demonstrate that traffic stays within Google Cloud.\n- You can create a user-defined global Private Service Connect endpoint IP address (/32). For more information, see [IP address requirements](/vpc/docs/about-accessing-google-apis-endpoints#ip-address-requirements) .\n- You create the Private Service Connect endpoint in the same VPC network as the Cloud Router.\n- You can assign DNS names to these internal IP addresses with meaningful names like`aiplatform-prodpsc.p.googleapis.com`. For more information, see [About accessing Google APIs through endpoints](/vpc/docs/about-accessing-google-apis-endpoints) .## Deployment considerations\nFollowing are some important considerations that affect how you use Private Google Access and Private Service Connect to access the Vertex AI API.\n### IP advertisement\nYou must advertise the Private Google Access subnet range or the Private Service Connect endpoint IP address to on-premises and multicloud environments from the Cloud Router as a custom route advertisement. For more information, see [Advertise custom IP ranges](/network-connectivity/docs/router/how-to/advertising-custom-ip) .\n### Firewall rules\nYou must ensure that the firewall configuration of on-premises and multicloud environments allows outbound traffic from the IP addresses of Private Google Access or Private Service Connect subnets.\n### DNS configuration\n- Your on-premises network must have DNS zones and records configured so that a request to`` `-aiplatform.googleapis.com`resolves to the [Private Google Access subnet](/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access-hybrid#config-domain) or the [Private Service Connect endpoint](/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-apis#on-premises) IP address.\n- You can create Cloud DNS managed private zones and use a Cloud DNS inbound server policy, or you can configure on-premises name servers. For example, you can use [BIND](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND) or [Microsoft Active Directory DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/networking/dns/dns-top) .\n- If your on-premises network is connected to a VPC network, you can use Private Service Connect to access Google APIs and services from on-premises hosts using the internal IP address of the endpoint. For more information, see [Access the endpoint from on-premises hosts](/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-apis#on-premises) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
