Predictions from an action recognition model return moments of actions, according to your own defined labels. The model assigns a confidence score to each prediction, which communicates how confident your model accurately identified an action. The higher the number - the higher the model's confidence is of the correctness of the prediction.\nThe following sample is the predicted result for a model that identifies the \"swing\" and \"jump\" actions in a video. Each result includes a label (\"swing\" or \"jump\") for the identified action, a time segment with the same start and end time that specifies the moment of the action, and a confidence score.\n**Note** : The following JSON Lines example includes line breaks for readability. In your JSON Lines files, line breaks are included only after each each JSON object.\n```\n{\n \"instance\": {\n \"content\": \"gs://bucket/video.mp4\",\n \"mimeType\": \"video/mp4\",\n \"timeSegmentStart\": \"1s\",\n \"timeSegmentEnd\": \"5s\"\n }\n \"prediction\": [{\n \"id\": \"1\",\n \"displayName\": \"swing\",\n \"timeSegmentStart\": \"1.2s\",\n \"timeSegmentEnd\": \"1.2s\",\n \"confidence\": 0.7\n }, {\n \"id\": \"2\",\n \"displayName\": \"jump\",\n \"timeSegmentStart\": \"3.4s\",\n \"timeSegmentEnd\": \"3.4s\",\n \"confidence\": 0.5\n }]\n}\n``", "content": "`", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
