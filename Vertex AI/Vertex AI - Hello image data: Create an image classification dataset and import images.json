After your dataset is created, use a CSV pointing to images in a public Cloud Storage bucket to import those images into the dataset.\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Set up your project and environment.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl) \n- Create an image classification dataset, and import images.\n- [Train an AutoML image classification model.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/training) \n- [Evaluate and analyze model performance.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/error-analysis) \n- [Deploy a model to an endpoint, and send a prediction.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/deploy-predict) \n- [Clean up your project.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/cleanup) \nEach page assumes that you have already performed the instructions from the previous pages of the tutorial.\n", "content": "## Image data input file\n**Key point** : A single dataset can be used for multiple objectives. This tutorial focuses on(applying a label to an image), but the same data could be used for another objective, such as(object identification and labeling).\nThe image files you use in this tutorial are from the flower dataset used in this [Tensorflow blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/how-to-classify-images-with-tensorflow-using-google-cloud-machine-learning-and-cloud-dataflow) . These input images are stored in a public Cloud Storage bucket. This publicly-accessible bucket also contains a CSV file you use for data import. This file has two columns: the first column lists an image's URI in Cloud Storage, and the second column contains the image's label. Below you can see some sample rows:\n`gs://cloud-samples-data/ai-platform/flowers/flowers.csv` :\n```\ngs://cloud-samples-data/ai-platform/flowers/daisy/10559679065_50d2b16f6d.jpg,daisygs://cloud-samples-data/ai-platform/flowers/dandelion/10828951106_c3cd47983f.jpg,dandeliongs://cloud-samples-data/ai-platform/flowers/roses/14312910041_b747240d56_n.jpg,rosesgs://cloud-samples-data/ai-platform/flowers/sunflowers/127192624_afa3d9cb84.jpg,sunflowersgs://cloud-samples-data/ai-platform/flowers/tulips/13979098645_50b9eebc02_n.jpg,tulips\n```\n## Create an image classification dataset and import data\nVisit the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/) to begin the process of creating your dataset and training your image classification model.\nWhen prompted, make sure to select the project that you used for your Cloud Storage bucket.\n- From the Get started with Vertex AI page, click **Create dataset** . \n- Specify a name for this dataset (optional).\n- In the Image tab of the \"Select a data type and objective\" section, choose the radio_button_checked **Image classification (Single-label)** radio option. In the Region drop-down menu select **US Central** . \n- Select **Create** to create the empty dataset. After selecting Create you will advance to the data import window.\n- Select the radio_button_checked **Selectimport files from Cloud Storage** and specify the Cloud Storage URI of the CSV file with the image location and label data. For this quickstart, the CSV file is at `gs://cloud-samples-data/ai-platform/flowers/flowers.csv` . Copy and paste the following into the \"Import file path\" field:- ```\ncloud-samples-data/ai-platform/flowers/flowers.csv\n```\n \n- Click **Continue** to begin image import. The import process takes a few minutes. When it completes, you are taken to the next page that shows all of the images identified for your dataset, both labeled and unlabeled images.When using the indicated flower dataset, you will see several warning alerts. This is purposeful, to show you error messages you may encounter with your own data.## What's next\nFollow the [next page of this tutorial](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/training) to start an AutoML model training job.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
