You need to stop any active online serving operation that's currently active from the feature view you want to delete. Otherwise, the online serving operation fails after you delete the feature view.\nUse the following samples to delete a feature view from an online store in your project.\nUse the following instructions to delete a feature view using the Google Cloud console.- In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to the **Feature Store** page. [Go to the Feature Store page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/feature-store) \n- Click **Online store** .\n- Click the name of the online store to view its details on the **Online store details** page.\n- In the **Feature views** section, XZselect checkbox next to the feature view that you want to delete.\n- Click **Delete** and then click **Confirm** .\nTo delete a [FeatureView](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews#resource:-featureView) instance, send a `DELETE` request by using the [featureViews.delete](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews/delete) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the online store is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the online store containing the feature view.\n- : The name of the feature view you want to delete.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nDELETE https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews/FEATUREVIEW_NAME\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X DELETE \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews/FEATUREVIEW_NAME\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\n$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token$headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $cred\" }Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method DELETE ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews/FEATUREVIEW_NAME\" | Select-Object -Expand Content\n```\nYou should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/operations/OPERATION_ID\",\n \"metadata\": {\n \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.DeleteOperationMetadata\",\n \"genericMetadata\": {\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-09-15T17:30:31.741064Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-09-15T17:30:31.741064Z\"\n }\n }\n}\n```\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn how to [update a feature view](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-featureview) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
