Follow these steps to avoid incurring unexpected charges.\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Setting up your project and environment.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl) \n- [Creating a text classification dataset .](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/dataset) \n- [Training an AutoML text classification model.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/training) \n- [Deploy model to an endpoint and send a prediction.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/deploy-predict) \n- Cleaning up your project.\nEach page assumes that you have already performed the instructions from the previous pages of the tutorial.\n", "content": "## Delete Vertex AI resources\nThis section describes how to delete the following project resources: endpoint, model, dataset, and Cloud Storage bucket.\n### Delete your endpoint\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Endpoints** page. [Go to Endpoints](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/endpoints) \n- Click your endpoint.\n- On the endpoint details page, find the row for your model. Click more_vert **View more\u00a0>Undeploy model from endpoint** .\n- In the **Undeploy model from endpoint** dialog, click **Undeploy** .\n- Go back to the **Endpoints** page.\n- Find your endpoint, click more_vert **View more\u00a0>Delete endpoint** .\n- In the **Delete endpoint** dialog, click **Confirm** .\n### Delete your model\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Model Registry** page. [Go to the Model Registry page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/models) \n- Find your model, click more_vert **View more\u00a0>\u00a0Delete model** .\n- In the **Delete model** dialog, click **Delete** .\n### Delete your dataset\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Datasets** page. [Go to the Datasets page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/datasets) \n- Find your dataset, click more_vert **View more\u00a0>\u00a0Delete dataset** .## Delete your Cloud Storage bucket\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage **Buckets** page. [Go to Buckets](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) \n- Click the checkbox for the bucket that you want to delete.\n- To delete the bucket,  clickdelete **Delete** , and then follow the  instructions.\n## Cloud Shell session\nNo action is required. Cloud Shell incurs no charges, and it [automatically deletes your home disk after a period ofinactivity](/shell/docs/limitations#usage_limits) .\n## What's next\n- To learn about additional ways to train ML models on Vertex AI, try one of the other [Vertex AI tutorials](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials) .\n- Read an [overview of how Vertex AIworks](/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
