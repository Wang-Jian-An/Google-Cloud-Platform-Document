The rules for naming are consistent for both types of resource. Each name:\n- Must only contain letters, numbers, dashes and underscores.\n- Is case-sensitive.\n- Must start with a letter.\n- Must be no more than 128 characters long.\nYou should create names that are easy to distinguish in lists of resources. Also, you should name your models so that they are easily identified by the dataset they use. For example, `census_wide_deep` is better than `my_new_model` ", "content": ".", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
