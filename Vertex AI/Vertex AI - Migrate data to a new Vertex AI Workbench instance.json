See the [requirements for upgrading the environment ofa Vertex AI Workbench instance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/upgrade#requirements) .\n## Migration options\nTo migrate data and files from one Vertex AI Workbench instance to another, consider using the following methods:\n- **Use GitHub** : Copy your data and files to a GitHub repository by using the Git extension for JupyterLab.\n- **Use Cloud Storage and the terminal** : Copy your data and files to Cloud Storage and then to another instance by using the terminal.\n- **Use Cloud Storage within JupyterLab notebooks** : Copy your data and files to Cloud Storage and then to another instance by running commands within your respective instances' notebook cells.\nThis guide describes how to migrate data and files by using Cloud Storage and the terminal.\n## Requirements\nYou must have terminal access to your Vertex AI Workbench instance. Terminal access is manually set when you create an instance. The terminal access setting cannot be changed after the instance is created.\n## Before you begin\n[Create a Cloud Storage bucket](/storage/docs/creating-buckets) in the same project where your Vertex AI Workbench instance is located.\n## Migrate your data to a new Vertex AI Workbench instance\nTo migrate data and files to a new Vertex AI Workbench instance by using Cloud Storage and the terminal, complete the following steps.\n- In your Vertex AI Workbench instance's JupyterLab interface, select **File\u00a0>New\u00a0> Terminal** to open a terminal window.\n- Use the [gsutil tool](/storage/docs/gsutil) to copy your user data to a Cloud Storage bucket. The following example command copies all of the files from your instance's `/home/jupyter/` directory to a directory in a Cloud Storage bucket.```\ngsutil cp -R /home/jupyter/* gs://BUCKET_NAMEPATH\n```Replace the following:- ``: the name of your Cloud Storage bucket\n- ``: the path to the directory where you want to copy your files, for example:`/copy/jupyter/`\n- [Createa Vertex AI Workbench instance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/create) .\n- In your new Vertex AI Workbench instance's JupyterLab interface, select **File\u00a0>New\u00a0> Terminal** to open a terminal window.\n- Use the `gsutil tool` to restore your data on the new instance. The following example command copies all of the files from a Cloud Storage directory to the your new instance's `/home/jupyter/` directory.```\ngsutil cp gs://BUCKET_NAMEPATH* /home/jupyter/\n```## What's next\n- Learn how to [upgrade the environment ofVertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/upgrade) .\n- Learn more about [usingSSH access](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/ssh-access) to connect to your Vertex AI Workbench instance.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
