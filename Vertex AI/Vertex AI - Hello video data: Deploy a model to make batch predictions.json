You will be providing a list of videos (source file) to be classified.Prerequisite: Create a [Cloud Storage](/storage/docs/quickstart-console#create_a_bucket) bucket.are the basic containers that hold your data in Cloud Storage.- Provide a Batch prediction name.\n- For theuse`[gs://]automl-video-demo-data/hmdb_split1_predict.jsonl`\n- Provide theto your bucket. Results are added to the`predict_results`folder`[gs://]` `` `/predict_results`\n- Select **Create** .\n ## View results\nOnce the job is done, `demo_data_predictions` shows up under the **Batch prediction** tab.\n- Click the demo-model-prediction link in the **Batch predictions** view. Details of the batch prediction job appear.\n- To view the results in your storage bucket, click the link to the right of **Export location** . The results in your storage bucket appear. \n- To see your results in the Google Cloud console, click **View results** . A video appears. From the drop-down, you can select other videos you want to see the results for. You can also adjust the confidence threshold to hide/show the predictions. ## View the results\nIn the results for your video annotation, Vertex AI provides three types of information:\n- Labels for the video. You can find this information under the **Segment** tab below the video on the results page.\n- Labels for shots within the video. You can find this information under the **Shot** tab below the video on the results page.\n- Labels for each 1-second interval within the video. You can find this information under the **1 Second Interval** tab below the video on the results page.\nIf you want to see more labels, you can change the threshold score when you request a prediction. AutoML video only displays the labels that are above the specified threshold.\nIf the prediction fails, the status of the prediction shows \"Failed\" and a red icon under the **Batch Predictions** list.\nIf all predictions succeeded, the status of the prediction shows \"Finished\" and a green icon under **Batch Predictions** list. On the results page for that prediction, you can view the results for the videos that Vertex AI has annotated.\n## What's next\n- To clean up resources that you have created, follow the [last page of the tutorial](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/cleanup) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
