If an online store instance contains existing feature view instances, you can use the `force` query parameter to delete the online store and its feature views.\n**Caution:** Before deleting an online store containing feature views, stop any online serving operations that are in progress from those feature views.\nUse the following samples to delete an online store along with its constituent feature views from your project.\nUse the following instructions to delete an online store and all its feature views using the Google Cloud console.- In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to the **Feature Store** page. [Go to the Feature Store page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/feature-store) \n- Click **Online store** .\n- Select checkbox next to the online store that you want to delete.\n- Click **Delete** and then click **Confirm** .\nTo delete a [FeatureOnlineStore](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores#resource:-featureOnlineStore) resource, send a `DELETE` request by using the [featureOnlineStores.delete](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores/delete) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the online store is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the online store instance that you want to delete.\n- : Optional. To delete the online instance even if it contains feature views,  enter`true`. The default value is`false`.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nDELETE https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME?force=BOOLEAN\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X DELETE \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME?force=BOOLEAN\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.
