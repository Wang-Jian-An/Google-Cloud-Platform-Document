To confirm that you comply with the license terms, review any applicable model, dataset, or software licenses. Also confirm that you comply with any restrictions in the license (such as use-based restrictions included in the CreativeML Open RAIL-M [license](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license) ).\nModel Garden in the Google Cloud console is an ML model library that helps you discover, test, customize, and deploy Google proprietary and select OSS models and assets.\nThe following topics introduce you to the AI models available in Model Garden and how to use them.\n", "content": "## Explore models\nTo view the list of available Vertex AI and open source foundation, tunable, and task-specific models, go to the Model Garden page in the Google Cloud console.\n[Go to Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden)\nThe model categories available in Model Garden are:\n| Category    | Description                                      |\n|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Foundation models  | Pretrained multitask large models that can be tuned or customized for specific tasks using Vertex AI Studio, Vertex AI API, and the Vertex AI SDK for Python. |\n| Fine-tunable models  | Models that you can finetune using a custom notebook or pipeline.                        |\n| Task-specific solutions | Most of these prebuilt models are ready to use. Many can be customized using your own data.                 |\nTo filter models in the filter pane, specify the following:\n- **Modalities** : Click the modalities (data types) that you want in the model.\n- **Tasks** : Click the task that you want the model to perform.\n- **Features** : Click the features that you want in the model.\nTo learn more about each model, click its model card.\n## Models available in Model Garden\nYou can find Google's first-party models and select open source models in Model Garden.\n### List of Google's first-party models\nThe following table lists the Google's first-party models that are available in Model Garden:### List of models with open source tuning or serving recipes in Model Garden\nThe following table lists the OSS models that support open source tuning or serving recipes in Model Garden:\n## How to use model cards\nClick a model card to use the model associated with it. For example, you can click a model card to test prompts, tune a model, create applications, and view code samples.\nTo learn how to use models associated with model cards, click one of the following tabs:\nUse the Vertex AI PaLM API model card to test prompts.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Model Garden** page. [Go to Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) \n- Find a supported model that you want to test and click **View details** .\n- Click **Open prompt design** .You're taken to the **Prompt design** page.\n- In **Prompt** , enter the prompt that you want to test.\n- Optional: Configure the model parameters.\n- Click **Submit** .\nTo tune supported models, use a Vertex AI pipeline or a notebook.\nThe BERT and T5-FLAN models support model tuning using a pipeline.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Model Garden** page. [Go to Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) \n- In **Search models** , enter **BERT** or **T5-FLAN** , then click the magnifying glass to search.\n- Click **View details** on the **T5-FLAN** or the **BERT** model card.\n- Click **Open fine-tuning pipeline** .You're taken to the Vertex AI pipelines page.\n- To start tuning, click **Create run** .\nThe model cards for most open source foundation models and fine-tunable models support tuning in a notebook.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Model Garden** page. [Go to Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) \n- Find a supported model that you want to tune and click **View details** .\n- Click **Open notebook** .\nThe model card for the Stable Diffusion model supports deploying to an endpoint.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Model Garden** page. [Go to Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) \n- Find a supported model that you want to deploy. On its model card, click **View details** .\n- Click **Deploy** .You're asked to save a copy of the model to Model Registry.\n- In **Model name** , enter a name for the model.\n- Click **Save** .The **Deploy to endpoint** pane appears.\n- Define your endpoint as follows:- **Endpoint name** : Enter a name for the endpoint.\n- **Region** : Select a region to create the endpoint in.\n- **Access** : To make the endpoint accessible through a REST API, selectradio_button_checked **Standard** . To create a private connect to the endpoint, selectradio_button_checked **Private** .\n- Click **Continue** .\n- Follow the instructions in the Google Cloud console and configure your model settings.\n- Click **Continue** .\n- Optional: Click the **Enable model monitoring for this endpoint** toggle to enable model monitoring.\n- Click **Deploy** .\nMost of the model cards for task-specific solutions models contain code samples that you can copy and test.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Model Garden** page. [Go to Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) \n- Find a supported model that you want to view code samples for and click the **Documentation** tab.\n- The page scrolls to the documentation section with sample code embedded in place.\nThe model cards for applicable computer vision models support creating a vision application.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Model Garden** page. [Go to Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) \n- Find a vision model in the Task specific solutions section that you want to use to create a vision application and click **View details** .\n- Click **Build app** .You're taken to Vertex AI Vision.\n- In **Application name** , enter a name for your application and click **Continue** .\n- Select a billing plan and click **Create** .You're taken to Vertex AI Vision Studio where you can continue creating your computer vision application.## Pricing\nFor the open source models in Model Garden, you are charged for use of following on Vertex AI:\n- **Model tuning** : You are charged for the compute resources used at the same rate as custom training.
