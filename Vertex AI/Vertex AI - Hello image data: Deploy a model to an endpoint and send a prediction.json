After your model is deployed to this new endpoint, send an image to the model for label prediction.\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Set up your project and environment.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl) \n- [Create an image classification dataset, and import images.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/dataset) \n- [Train an AutoML image classification model.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/training) \n- [Evaluate and analyze model performance.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/error-analysis) \n- Deploy a model to an endpoint, and send a prediction.\n- [Clean up your project.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/cleanup) \nEach page assumes that you have already performed the instructions from the previous pages of the tutorial.\n", "content": "## Deploy your model to an endpoint\nAccess your trained model to deploy it to a new or existing endpoint from the Models page:\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Training** page. [Go to the Training page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/training) \n- Select your trained AutoML model. This takes you to the **Evaluate** tab where you can view model performance metrics.\n- Choose the tab **Deploy & test** tab.\n- Click **Deploy to endpoint** .\n- Choose radio_button_checked **Create newendpoint** , set the endpoint name to `hello_automl_image` , then click **Continue** .\n- In **Model settings** , accept the **Traffic split** of **100%** , enter **1** in **Number of compute nodes** , then click **Done** .\n- Click **Deploy** to deploy your model to your new endpoint.\nIt takes several minutes to create the endpoint and deploy the AutoML model to the new endpoint.\n## Send a prediction to your model\nAfter the endpoint creation process finishes you can send a single image annotation (prediction) request in the Google Cloud console.\n- Navigate to the \"Test your model\" section of the same **Deploy & test** tab you used to create an endpoint in the previous step ( **Models > your_model > tab Deploy & test** ).\n- Click **Upload image** and choose a locally saved image for prediction, and view its predicted label.## What's next\nFollow the [last page of the tutorial](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/cleanup) to clean up resources that you have created.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
