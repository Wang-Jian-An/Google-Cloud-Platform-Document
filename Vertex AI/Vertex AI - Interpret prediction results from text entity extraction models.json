The higher the number, the higher the model's confidence in the correctness of the prediction.\n", "content": "## Example batch prediction output\nThe following sample is the predicted result for an entity extraction model that was trained to detect diseases. The offsets (start and end character offsets) specify the location where the model detected an entity in the document, and the `content` field shows the detected entity.\nThe display names show the labels that the model associated with each entity, such as `SpecificDisease` or `DiseaseClass` . The labels map to the text segments in order.\n**Note** : The following JSON Lines example includes line breaks for readability. In your JSON Lines files, line breaks are included only after each each JSON object.\n```\n{\n \"key\": 1,\n \"predictions\": {\n \"ids\": [  \"1234567890123456789\",\n  \"2234567890123456789\",\n  \"3234567890123456789\"\n ],\n \"displayNames\": [  \"SpecificDisease\",\n  \"DiseaseClass\",\n  \"SpecificDisease\"\n ],\n \"textSegmentStartOffsets\": [13, 40, 57],\n \"textSegmentEndOffsets\": [29, 51, 75],\n \"confidences\": [  0.99959725141525269,\n  0.99912621492484128,\n  0.99935531616210938\n ]\n }\n}\n```", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
