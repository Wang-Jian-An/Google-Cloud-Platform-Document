After your dataset is created and data is imported, use the Google Cloud console to review the training videos, and begin model training.\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Setting up your project.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl) \n- [Creating a video classification dataset.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/dataset) \n- Training an AutoML video classification model.\n- [Deploying the model for batch predictions.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/deploy-predict) \n- [Cleaning up your project.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/cleanup) \nEach page assumes that you've already performed the instructions from the previous pages of the tutorial.\n", "content": "## Review imported videos\nThe email you received informing you that importing of the file is complete has a link to the **Browse** tab for the dataset containing an annotation set. This annotation set contains the data from the imported file. Alternatively, click [Go to the Datasets page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/datasets) and select the appropriate dataset.\n## Begin AutoML model training\nTo begin training,\n- Select **Train new model** in the right panel. \n- **Choose training method** . Defaults to **AutoML** . Leave as is. \n- Click **continue** .\n- **Edit Model name** . Note: If you do not provide a name for your model, one will be assigned based on the dataset name. \n- Select **Train new model** . A \"demo_data\" training job appears under \"Training jobs and models\" in the right panel. \nTraining takes several hours for this demo dataset. You will receive an email letting you know what the training time is estimated to be around 15 minutes after training starts.\nTo cancel ongoing training of a model, first click the **Training** tab in the content navigation menu, then clickmore_vert **View more\u00a0>\u00a0\n Cancel training pipeline** . The pipeline is canceled in a couple of minutes.\nTo check the current training status, click the training job \"demo_data\" in the panel on the right. A model property page appears.\nYou will also get another notification email once the model training finishes.\n\"Training time(actual)\" is the time used to calculate the training cost andthe time spent training.\n## Check evaluation results\nAfter training is completed, select your demo_data model to check the model evaluation results.\nThis takes you to the **Evaluate** tab where you can view model performance metrics.\n## What's next\nFollow the [next page of this tutorial](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/deploy-predict) to deploy your trained AutoML model for batch prediction.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
