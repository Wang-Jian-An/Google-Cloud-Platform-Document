{"title": "Vertex AI - Introduction to Vertex AI Model Registry", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/introduction", "abstract": "# Vertex AI - Introduction to Vertex AI Model Registry\nThe Vertex AI Model Registry is a central repository where you can manage the lifecycle of your ML models. From the Model Registry, you have an overview of your models so you can better organize, track, and train new versions. When you have a model version you would like to deploy, you can assign it to an endpoint directly from the registry, or using aliases, deploy models to an endpoint.\nThe Vertex AI Model Registry supports custom models and all AutoML data types - text, tabular, image, and video. The Model Registry can also support BigQuery ML models. If you have models trained in BigQuery ML, you can register them with the Model Registry.\nFrom the model version details page you can evaluate, deploy to an endpoint, setup batch prediction, and view specific model details. The Vertex AI Model Registry provides a straightforward and streamlined interface to manage and deploy your best models to production.\n", "content": "## Common workflow\nThere are many valid workflows for working in the Model Registry. To get started, you might want to follow these guidelines to understand what you can do in the Model Registry and at what stage in your model-training journey.\n- Import models to the Model Registry.\n- Create new models, assign a model version the default alias, ready for production.\n- Add other aliases, or labels to help you manage and organize your models and model versions.\n- Deploy your models to an endpoint.\n- Run batch prediction, and start your model evaluation pipeline.\n- View your model details and view performance metrics from the model details page.\nTo learn more about how to integrate your BigQuery ML models with Vertex AI, see the [BigQuery ML documentation.](/bigquery-ml/docs/managing-models-vertex)\n## Search and discover models using Dataplex's Data Catalog service\nDataplex's Data Catalog service is a fully managed, scalable metadata management service that provides a centralized location to search for models across projects and regions.\nFor details, see [Use Data Catalog to search for model and dataset resources](/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/model-data-catalog) .\n## What's next\n- To get started using Vertex AI Model Registry, see- [Import models to Vertex AI Model Registry](/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/import-model) \n- [Versioning with Vertex AI Model Registry](/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/versioning) \n- [How to use aliases with Vertex AI Model Registry](/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/model-alias) \n- [Integrate a BigQuery ML model with Model Registry](/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/model-registry-bqml) \n- [How to copy a model to a different region from the Vertex AI Model Registry](/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/copy-model)", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
