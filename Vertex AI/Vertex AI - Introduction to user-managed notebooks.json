On January 30, 2025, support for  user-managed notebooks will end and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nVertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks instances let you create and manage deep learning virtual machine (VM) instances that are prepackaged with [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) .\nUser-managed notebooks instances have a preinstalled suite of deep learning packages, including support for the TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. You can configure either CPU-only or GPU-enabled instances.\nYour user-managed notebooks instances are protected by Google Cloud authentication and authorization and are available by using a user-managed notebooks instance URL. User-managed notebooks instances also integrate with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and can sync with a GitHub repository.\nUser-managed notebooks instances save you the difficulty of creating and configuring a [Deep Learning virtual machine](/deep-learning-vm/docs) by providing verified, optimized, and tested images for your chosen framework.\n", "content": "## Preinstalled software\nYou can configure a user-managed notebooks instance to include the following:\n- JupyterLab ( [see version details](#jupyterlab-version) )\n- Python 3, with key packages:- numpy\n- sklearn\n- scipy\n- pandas\n- nltk\n- pillow\n- [fairness-indicators](https://www.tensorflow.org/responsible_ai/fairness_indicators/guide) for TensorFlow 2.3 and 2.4 user-managed notebooks instances\n- many others\n- R version 4. , with key packages:- xgboost\n- ggplot2\n- caret\n- nnet\n- rpy2 (an R package for accessing R in Python notebooks)\n- randomForest\n- many others\n- Anaconda\n- Nvidia packages with the latest Nvidia driver for GPU-enabled instances:- CUDA 11.and 12.\n- CuDNN 7.\n- NCCL 2.\n## JupyterLab version details\nJupyterLab 3. is preinstalled on new user-managed notebooks instances by default. For instances created before the [M80 Deep Learning VMrelease](/deep-learning-vm/docs/release-notes#September_24_2021) , JupyterLab 1. was preinstalled.\nTo create an earlier version of a user-managed notebooks instance, see [Create a specific version of a user-managed notebooksinstance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/create-specific-version) .\n## VPC Service Controls\nVPC Service Controls provides additional security for your user-managed notebooks instances. For more information, see the [Overview ofVPC Service Controls](/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview) . To use user-managed notebooks within a service perimeter, see [Usea user-managed notebooks instance within a serviceperimeter](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/service-perimeter) .\n## Upgrades\nYou can upgrade your environment to use new capabilities and to benefit from framework updates, package updates, and bug fixes. You can upgrade environments manually or through an automatic update setting. To learn more, see [Upgrade the environment ofa user-managed notebooks instance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/upgrade) .\n## User-managed notebooks and Dataproc Hub\nDataproc Hub is a customized [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) server. Administrators can create Dataproc Hub instances that can spawn single-user [Dataproc](/dataproc/docs) clusters to host user-managed notebooks environments. For more information, see [Configure Dataproc Hub](/dataproc/docs/tutorials/dataproc-hub-admins) .\n## User-managed notebooks and Dataflow\nYou can use user-managed notebooks within a pipeline, and then run the pipeline on [Dataflow](/dataflow/docs) . For information about how to create an [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/) user-managed notebooks instance that you can use with Dataflow, see [Developing interactively with Apache Beamnotebooks](/dataflow/docs/guides/interactive-pipeline-development) .\n## Limitations\nConsider the following limitations of user-managed notebooks when planning your project:\n- User-managed notebooks instances are highly customizable and can be ideal for users who need a lot of control over their environment. Therefore, user-managed notebooks instances can require more time to set up and manage than managed notebooks instances. Managed notebooks instances can be more ideal for users who don't need a lot of control over their environment. For more information, see [Introduction tomanaged notebooks](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/introduction) .\n- Third party JupyterLab extensions are not supported.\n- For Dataproc Hub user-managed notebooks instances, disabling file downloading from the JupyterLab user interface is not supported. User-managed notebooks instances that use the Dataproc Hub framework permit file downloading even if you don't select **Enable file downloading from JupyterLab UI** when you create the instance.\n- When you use [Access Context Manager](/access-context-manager/docs/create-basic-access-level#corporate-network-example) and [BeyondCorp Enterprise](/beyondcorp-enterprise/docs/access-levels) to protect managed notebooks instances with context-aware access controls, access is evaluated each time the user authenticates to the instance. For example, access is evaluated the first time the user accesses JupyterLab and whenever they access it thereafter if their web browser's cookie has expired.## Pricing\n[Learn more about Vertex AI Workbenchpricing](/vertex-ai/pricing) .\n## What's next\nTo get started with user-managed notebooks, [createa user-managed notebooksinstance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/create-new) , open JupyterLab, and try one of the samples in the **tutorials** folder.\nThen [installdependencies](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/dependencies) that you'll need to do your work.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
