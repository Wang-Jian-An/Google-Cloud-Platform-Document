{"title": "Vertex AI - Create a feature group", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featuregroup", "abstract": "# Vertex AI - Create a feature group\nYou can create a feature group to register a BigQuery table or view that contains your feature data.\nFor any BigQuery table or view that you associate with a feature group, you need to ensure the following:\n- The schema of the data source conforms to the [Data source preparation guidelines](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/prepare-data-source#guidelines) .\n- The data source contains the entity IDs as `string` values in a column named `entity_id` .\n- The data source contains the feature timestamps of type `timestamp` in a column called `feature_timestamp` .\nAfter you create a feature group and associate the BigQuery data source, you can [create features](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-feature) to associate with the columns in the data source. It's optional to specify a data source while creating the feature group. However, you need to specify a data source before you create features.\nRegistering your data source using feature groups and features has the following advantages:\n- You can define a feature view for online serving by using specific feature columns from multiple BigQuery data sources.\n- You can format your data as a time series by including the `feature_timestamp` column. Vertex AI Feature Store serves only the latest feature values from the feature data and excludes historical values.\n**Note:** To learn how to set up online serving from a BigQuery data source without creating feature groups and features, see [Create feature view from BigQuery source](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featureview#create_from_bq) .\nUse the following sample to create a feature group and associate a BigQuery data source.\nUse the following instructions to create a feature group using the Google Cloud console.- In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to the **Feature Store** page. [Go to the Feature Store page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/feature-store) \n- In the **Feature groups** section, click **Create** to open the **Basic info** pane on the **Create Feature Group** page.\n- Specify the **Feature group name** .\n- Optional: To add labels, click **Add label** , and specify the label name and value. You can add multiple labels to a feature group.\n- In the **BigQuery path** field, click **Browse** to select BigQuery source table or view to associate with the feature group.\n- Optional: In the **Entity ID column** list, click the entity ID column from the BigQuery source table or view.\n- Click **Continue** .\n- In the **Register** pane, click one of the following options to indicate whether you want to add features to the new feature group:- **Include all columns from the BigQuery table** \u2014Create features within the feature group for all the columns in the BigQuery source table or view.\n- **Manually enter your features** \u2014Create features based on specific columns in the BigQuery source. For each feature, enter a **Feature name** and click the corresponding BigQuery source column name in the list.To add more features, click **Add another feature** .\n- **Create an empty feature group** \u2014Create the feature group without adding features to it.\n- Click **Create** .\nTo create a [FeatureGroup](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups#resource:-featuregroup) resource, send a `POST` request by using the [featureGroups.create](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups/create) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where you want to create the feature group, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the new feature group that you want to create.\n- : URI of the BigQuery source table or view that you want to register for the feature group.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPOST https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups?feature_group_id=FEATUREGROUP_NAME\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"big_query\": {\n \"big_query_source\": {\n  \"input_uri\": \"BIGQUERY_SOURCE_URI\"\n }\n }\n}\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nSave the request body in a file named `request.json` ,  and execute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X POST \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\" \\ -d @request.json \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups?feature_group_id=FEATUREGROUP_NAME\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nSave the request body in a file named `request.json` ,  and execute the following command:\n```\n$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token$headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $cred\" }Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: \"application/json; charset=utf-8\" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups?feature_group_id=FEATUREGROUP_NAME\" | Select-Object -Expand Content\n```\nYou should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATUREGROUP_NAME/operations/OPERATION_ID\",\n \"metadata\": {\n \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.UpdateFeatureGroupOperationMetadata\",\n \"genericMetadata\": {\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-09-18T03:00:13.060636Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-09-18T03:00:13.060636Z\"\n }\n }\n}\n```\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn how to [create a feature](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-feature) .\n- Learn how to [update a feature group](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-featuregroup) .\n- Learn how to [delete a feature group](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/delete-featuregroup) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
