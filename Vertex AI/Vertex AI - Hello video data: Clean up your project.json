Follow these steps to avoid incurring unexpected charges from some of the resources.\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Setting up your project.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl) \n- [Creating a video classification dataset.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/dataset) \n- [Training an AutoML video classification model.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/training) \n- [Deploying the model for batch predictions.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/deploy-predict) \n- Cleaning up your project.\nEach page assumes that you've already performed the instructions from the previous pages of the tutorial.\n", "content": "## Delete Vertex AI resources\nThis section describes how to delete the following project resources: model, dataset, and Cloud Storage bucket.\n### Delete your model\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Models** page. [Go to the Models page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/models) \n- Find your model. On that row, click **Viewmore more_vert** . Then click **Delete model** .\n- In the **Delete model** dialog, click **Delete** .\n### Delete your dataset\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Datasets** page. [Go to the Datasets page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/datasets) \n- Find your dataset. On that row, click **Viewmore more_vert** . Then click **Delete dataset** .## Clean up your Cloud Shell session\nCloud Shell incurs no charges, and it [automatically deletes your homedisk after a period of inactivity](/shell/docs/limitations) .\n## Delete your Cloud Storage bucket\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage **Buckets** page. [Go to Buckets](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) \n- Click the checkbox for the bucket that you want to delete.\n- To delete the bucket,  clickdelete **Delete** , and then follow the  instructions.\n## What's next\n- To learn about additional ways to train ML models on Vertex AI, try one of the other [Vertex AI tutorials](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials) .\n- Read an [overview of how Vertex AIworks](/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
