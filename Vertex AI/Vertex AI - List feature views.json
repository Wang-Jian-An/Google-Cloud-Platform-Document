{"title": "Vertex AI - List feature views", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/list-featureviews", "abstract": "# Vertex AI - List feature views\nYou can retrieve a list of all the feature view instances created within an online store in your Google Cloud project. For each feature view, you can also view the feature data source, which can be either of the following:\n- One or more feature groups and their constituent features. Each feature group is associated with a feature data source, such as a BigQuery table or view. Each feature designates a column in the BigQuery data source.\n- A BigQuery table or view directly associated with the feature view.\nUse the following samples to retrieve a list of feature views created for an online store in your project for a specific location.\nUse the following instructions to view the list of feature views in an online store using the Google Cloud console.- In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to the **Feature Store** page. [Go to the Feature Store page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/feature-store) \n- Click **Online store** .\n- Click the name of the online store to view its details on the **Online store details** page.\n- In the **Feature views** section, you can view the list of all the online stores for the selected location.\nTo retrieve a list of all the [FeatureView](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews#resource:-featureView) instances created within a specific online store in your project, send a `GET` request by using the [featureViews.list](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews/list) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the online store is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the online store for which you want to view the list of feature views.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X GET \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\n$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token$headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $cred\" }Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews\" | Select-Object -Expand Content\n```\nYou should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"featureViews\": [ {\n  \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews/FEATUREVIEW_NAME\",\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-09-06T23:46:49.936284Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-09-06T23:46:49.936284Z\",\n  \"etag\": \"AMEw9yOStRkXitA-ICOx0niGcNUAKkG3a5JNwo38VF-bT6BmIgdSmkd8Rskgi-NFgKmi\",\n  \"featureRegistrySource\": {\n  \"featureGroups\": [   {\n   \"featureGroupId\": \"FEATUREGROUP_ID\",\n   \"featureIds\": [    \"FEATURE_ID_1\",\n    \"FEATURE_ID_2\",\n   ]\n   }\n  ]\n  }\n }\n ]\n}\n```\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn how to [update a feature view](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-featureview) .\n- Learn how to [delete a feature view](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/delete-featureview) .\n- [Add more feature views](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featureview) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
