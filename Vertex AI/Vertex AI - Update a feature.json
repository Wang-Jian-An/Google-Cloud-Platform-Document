{"title": "Vertex AI - Update a feature", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-feature", "abstract": "# Vertex AI - Update a feature\nWithin a feature group, you can update a feature to associate it with a specific column in the BigQuery data source that's associated with the feature group.\nWhile creating or updating a feature, you have the option to add user-defined metadata in the form of labels to the feature. For more information about how to update user-defined labels for a feature, see [Update labels for a feature](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/feature-labels#feature) .\nUse the following sample to update a feature within a feature group.\nTo update a [Feature](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups.features#resource:-feature) resource, send a `PATCH` request by using the [features.patch](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups.features/patch) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the feature group containing the feature is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the feature group containing the feature.\n- : The name of the feature you want to update.\n- : The column from the BigQuery source table or view that you want to associate while updating the feature.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPATCH https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME/features?feature_id=FEATURE_NAME\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"version_column_name\": \"VERSION_COLUMN_NAME\"\n}\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nSave the request body in a file named `request.json` ,  and execute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X PATCH \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\" \\ -d @request.json \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME/features?feature_id=FEATURE_NAME\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.
