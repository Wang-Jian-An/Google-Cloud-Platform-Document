On January 30, 2025, support for  user-managed notebooks will end and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/migrate-to-instances) .Learn how to create a Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks instance and open JupyterLab by using the Google Cloud console. This page also describes how to stop, start, reset, or delete a user-managed notebooks instance.To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the Google Cloud console, click **Guide me** :\n [Guide me](https://console.cloud.google.com/?walkthrough_id=vertex-ai--workbench--user-managed--create-user-managed-notebooks-instance-console-quickstart) \n", "content": "## Before you begin\n## Create an instance\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **User-managed notebooks** page. [Go to User-managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed) \n- Click add_box **Create new** .\n- For **Name** , enter `my-instance` .\n- Click **Create** .\nWhen you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see [Clean up](#clean-up) .## Open JupyterLabAfter you create your instance, Vertex AI Workbench automatically starts the instance. When the instance is ready to use, Vertex AI Workbench activates an **Open JupyterLab** link.- Next to your user-managed notebooks instance's name, click **Open JupyterLab** .Your user-managed notebooks instance opens JupyterLab.\n## Open a new notebook file\n- Select **File\u00a0> New\u00a0> Notebook** .\n- In the **Select Kernel** dialog, select **Python 3** , and then click **Select** .\n- Your new notebook file opens.\n## Change the kernelYou can change the kernel of your JupyterLab notebook file from the menu or in the file.\n- In JupyterLab, on the **Kernel** menu, click **Change kernel** .\n- In the **Select Kernel** dialog, select another kernel to use and then click **Select** .\n- In your JupyterLab notebook file, click the kernel name. \n- In the **Select Kernel** dialog, select another kernel to use and then click **Select** .\n## Stop your instance\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **User-managed notebooks** page. [Go to User-managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed) \n- Select the instance that you want to stop.\n- Click stop **Stop** .\n## Start your instance\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **User-managed notebooks** page. [Go to User-managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed) \n- Select the instance that you want to start.\n- Click play_arrow **Start** .\n## Reset your instanceResetting an instance forcibly wipes the memory contents of your virtual machine (VM) and resets the VM to its initial state. To learn more, see [Reseta VM](/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance#resetting_an_instance) .- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **User-managed notebooks** page. [Go to User-managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed) \n- Select the instance that you want to reset.\n- Click **Reset** .\n## Clean upTo avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for   the resources used on this page, follow these steps.\nIf you created a new project to learn about Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks and you no longer need the project, [delete the project](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) .\nIf you used an existing Google Cloud project, delete the resources you created to avoid incurring charges to your account:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **User-managed notebooks** page. [Go to User-managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed) \n- Select the row containing the instance that you want to delete.\n- Click delete **Delete** . (Depending on the size of your window, the **Delete** button might be in the more_vert options menu.)\n- To confirm, click **Delete** .\n## What's next\n- Try one of the tutorials that is included in your new user-managed notebooks instance. In the JupyterLab folder **File Browser** , open the **tutorials** folder, and open one of the notebook files. \n- [Read the Introduction to user-managed notebooks](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/introduction) .\n- [Create a user-managed notebooks instancewith specific properties](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/create-new#create-with-options) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
