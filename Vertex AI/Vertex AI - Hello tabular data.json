Most of that time is not active time; you can close your browser window and return to the task later.\nThe goal of the trained model is to predict whether a bank client will buy a term deposit (a type of investment) using features like age, income, and profession. This type of model can help banks determine who to focus their marketing resources on.\nThis tutorial uses the [Bank marketing](https://datahub.io/machine-learning/bank-marketing) open-source dataset, which is available through a Creative Commons CCO: Public Domain license. The column names have been updated for clarity.\nTo complete this tutorial, you can either follow the instructions in the following pages or use the in-console walkthrough tutorial, which is a similar tutorial in the Google Cloud console.\n", "content": "## Tutorial pages\nThis tutorial has the following steps:\n| Steps              | Description                                    |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.
