Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nThis document provides an overview of the Tabular Workflow for TabNet pipelines and components. To learn how to train a model with TabNet, see [Train a model with TabNet](/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/tabular-workflows/tabnet-train) .\n[TabNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442) uses [sequential attention](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf) to choose which features to reason from at each decision step. This promotes interpretability and more efficient learning because the learning capacity is used for the most salient features.\n", "content": "## Benefits- Automatically selects the appropriate hyperparameter search space based on the dataset size, prediction type, and training budget.\n- Integrated with Vertex AI. The trained model is a Vertex AI model. You can run batch predictions or deploy the model for online predictions right away.\n- Provides inherent model interpretability. You can get insight into which features TabNet used to make its decision.\n- Supports GPU training.\n## TabNet on Vertex AI Pipelines\nTabular Workflow for TabNet is a managed instance of Vertex AI Pipelines.\n[Vertex AI Pipelines](/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction) is a serverless service that runs Kubeflow pipelines. You can use pipelines to automate and monitor your machine learning and data preparation tasks. Each step in a pipeline performs part of the pipeline's workflow. For example, a pipeline can include steps to split data, transform data types, and train a model. Since steps are instances of pipeline components, steps have inputs, outputs, and a container image. Step inputs can be set from the pipeline's inputs or they can depend on the output of other steps within this pipeline. These dependencies define the pipeline's workflow as a directed acyclic graph.\nTwo versions of the Tabular Workflow for TabNet are available:\n- [HyperparameterTuningJob](#hyperparametertuningjob) searches for the best set of hyperparameter values to use for model training.\n- [CustomJob](#customjob) lets you specify the hyperparameter values to use for model training. If you know exactly which hyperparameter values you need, you can specify them instead of searching for them and save on training resources.## Overview of TabNet CustomJob pipeline and components\nThe TabNet CustomJob pipeline can be illustrated by the following diagram:\nThe pipeline components are:\n- **feature-transform-engine** : Perform feature engineering. See [Feature Transform Engine](/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/tabular-workflows/feature-engineering) for details.\n- **split-materialized-data** : Split the materialized data into a training set, an evaluation set, and a test set.Input:- Materialized data`materialized_data`.\nOutput:- Materialized training split`materialized_train_split`.\n- Materialized evaluation split`materialized_eval_split`.\n- Materialized test set`materialized_test_split`.\n- **tabnet-trainer** : Perform model training.Input:- Instance baseline`instance_baseline`.\n- Training schema`training_schema`.\n- Transform output`transform_output`.\n- Materialized train split`materialized_train_split`.\n- Materialized evaluation split`materialized_eval_split`.\n- Materialized test set`materialized_test_split`.\nOutput:- Final model\n- **automl-tabular-infra-validator** : Validate the trained model by sending a prediction request and checking whether it completes successfully.\n- **model-upload** : Upload the model from the user's Cloud Storage bucket to Vertex AI as a Vertex AI model.\n- **condition-run-evaluation-2** : **Optional** . Use the test set to calculate evaluation metrics. Runs only when`run_evaluation`is set to`true`.## Overview of TabNet HyperparameterTuningJob pipeline and components\nThe TabNet HyperparameterTuningJob pipeline can be illustrated by the following diagram:- **feature-transform-engine** : Perform feature engineering.
