Follow these steps to avoid incurring unexpected charges from some of the resources.\n", "content": "## Delete Vertex AI resources\nThis section describes how delete the following project resources: endpoint, model, and dataset.\n### Delete your endpoint\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Endpoints** page. [Go to the Endpoints page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/endpoints) \n- Click your endpoint to open its details page.\n- On the row for your model, click **Undeploy modeldelete** .\n- In the **Undeploy model from endpoint** dialog, click **Undeploy** .\n- Return to the **Endpoints** tab, and find your endpoint. Click **View moremore_vert** .\n- Click **Remove endpoint** and confirm the operation.\n### Delete your model\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Models** page. [Go to the Models page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/models) \n- Find your model. On that row, click **Viewmore more_vert** .\n- Click **Delete model** and confirm the operation.\n### Delete your dataset\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Datasets** page. [Go to the Datasets page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/datasets) \n- Find your dataset. On that row, click **Viewmore more_vert** .\n- Click **Delete dataset** .## What's next\n- To learn about additional ways to train ML models on Vertex AI, try one of the other [Vertex AI tutorials](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials) .\n- Read an [overview of how Vertex AIworks](/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
