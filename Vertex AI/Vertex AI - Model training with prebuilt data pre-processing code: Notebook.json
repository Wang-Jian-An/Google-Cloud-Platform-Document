I want to be able to:\n- Use a Python data pre-processing library to clean up an in memory dataset (a Pandas Dataframe), in a notebook.\n- Train a model using Keras (again in a notebook).", "content": "## Notebook: Model experimentation with preprocessed data\nTo see an example of building a Vertex AI Experiments lineage for custom training,  run the \"Build Vertex AI Experiment lineage for custom training\" Jupyter notebook in one of the following  environments: [Openin Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/experiments/build_model_experimentation_lineage_with_prebuild_code.ipynb) | [Openin Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/deploy-notebook?download_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FGoogleCloudPlatform%2Fvertex-ai-samples%2Fmain%2Fnotebooks%2Fofficial%2Fexperiments%2Fbuild_model_experimentation_lineage_with_prebuild_code.ipynb) | [View on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/experiments/build_model_experimentation_lineage_with_prebuild_code.ipynb)\nIn the \"Build Vertex AI Experiments lineage for custom training\" notebook, you'll learn how to integrate preprocessing code in Vertex AI Experiments. Also, you'll build the experiment lineage that lets you record, analyze, debug, and audit metadata and artifacts produced along your ML journey.\nYou can view the artifact lineage in the Google Cloud console.\n## Relevant content\n- [Manually log data to an experiment run](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/log-data) \n- [Log summary metrics](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/log-data#summary-metrics) \n- [Log time series metrics](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/log-data#time_series_metrics) \n- [Log parameters](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/log-data#parameters) \n- [Log classification metrics](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/log-data#classification-metrics) \n- [Track executions and artifacts](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/track-executions-artifacts)", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
