On January 30, 2025, support for  managed notebooks will end and the ability to create managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nVertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instances are Google-managed environments with integrations and features that help you set up and work in an end-to-end notebook-based production environment. This page describes how to upgrade the environment of a managed notebooks instance.\n", "content": "## Upgrade methods\nThere is one way to upgrade a managed notebooks instance:\n- **Manual upgrade** : If an existing managed notebooks instance meets the [requirements](#requirements) for upgrading, you can upgrade the instance manually.## Requirements and limitations\nBackward compatibility with your managed notebooks isn't guaranteed. [Make a copy ofyour data](/vertex-ai/docs/general/troubleshooting-workbench#copy-user-data) before upgrading a managed notebooks instance.\nTo determine whether you can upgrade a specific managed notebooks instance, see the following requirements and limitations:\n- The Notebooks API must be  [enabled in the instance's Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/notebooks.googleapis.com) . For more information, see [List enabled services](/service-usage/docs/list-services#enabled) and [Enable an API](/endpoints/docs/openapi/enable-api#enabling_an_api) .\n- After upgrading, an instance cannot be rolled back to the previous version.\n- Instances that are version M112 or earlier use Python 3.7, and therefore can't be upgraded to a more recent version than M112. This is because M112 is the latest version to support Python 3.7.## How the upgrade works\nManaged notebooks instances are dual-disk, with one boot disk and one data disk. The upgrade process upgrades the boot disk to a new image while preserving your data on the data disk.\n### Which components are upgraded\nThe following table shows which components of your managed notebooks instance are upgraded, which are preserved, and which need to be reinstalled.\n| Component        | Upgrade result  |\n|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------|\n| Machine learning frameworks   | Upgraded   |\n| Machine learning data     | Preserved   |\n| Preinstalled Python dependencies  | Upgraded   |\n| User-installed Python packages   | Must be reinstalled |\n| Preinstalled operating system packages | Upgraded   |\n| GPU drivers       | Upgraded   |\n| Notebooks        | Preserved   |\n| User configurations     | Preserved   |\n## Before you begin\nBefore you upgrade, complete the following steps.\n- Check the [release notes](/vertex-ai/docs/release-notes) to learn about updates to newer versions.\n- [Make a copy of your data](/vertex-ai/docs/general/troubleshooting-workbench#copy-user-data) as a backup.## Check for a newer version of your instance's environment\nTo check whether a newer version of your instance's environment is available, access your instance from the Google Cloud console.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Managed notebooks** page. [Go to Managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/managed) \n- On the **Managed notebooks** tab, \"Upgrade available\" will appear in each upgradeable instance's row. There will also be a message at the top saying how many notebooks have available upgrades.## Upgrade your instance's environment to a newer version\nYou can manually upgrade a managed notebooks instance in the Google Cloud console.\n**Note:** Upgrades can affect user operations that are running.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Managed notebooks** page. [Go to Managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/managed) \n- If the instances that you want to upgrade aren't running, [start theinstances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/create-managed-notebooks-instance-console-quickstart#start_your_instance) . Vertex AI Workbench can only upgrade instances when they're running.\n- If you want to upgrade all upgradeable managed notebooks instances, then on the **Managed notebooks** tab, in the message at the top of the page, click the **Upgrade all** button. If there is no message at the top, then there are no managed notebooks instances that can be upgraded.\n- If you want to upgrade an individual notebook, then on the **Managed notebooks** tab, select the managed notebooks instance that you want to upgrade. There will be an \"Upgrade available\" message in the instance's row.\n- Make sure you have [made a copy of the data on yourinstance](/vertex-ai/docs/general/troubleshooting-workbench#copy-user-data) before continuing.\n- On the **Managed notebooks** tab, click **Upgrade** .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
