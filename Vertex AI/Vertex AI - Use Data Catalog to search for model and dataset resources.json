You can access all your managed resources across different projects using Dataplex's Data Catalog feature.\nData Catalog is a fully managed, scalable metadata management service within Dataplex. The service automatically catalogs the following metadata about Vertex AI models and datasets:\n- Name and fully-qualified name of model and dataset resources,\n- Location (region),\n- Creation date and last modification date,\n- Model Alias and Model Version ID Dataset data item count,\n- Description.\nVertex AI model and dataset metadata is automatically synced to Data Catalog at regular intervals, typically every few hours. You can use Data Catalog to discover and understand your Vertex AI metadata. Use Data Catalog to aid with the following activities:\n- Search for models with specific model alias, and model name across all projects and locations that you have access to. For example, to search for a specific model alias use.\n- Search for datasets using dataset name, dataset ID across all projects and locations that you have access to.\nWith Data Catalog, you can curate metadata by attaching tags to Vertex AI resources. Each tag can have multiple metadata fields, and can be based on a predefined or custom tag template.\nFor example, you could attach the following tag to a column that contains deployment environment name:\n```\ndeployed_to:Test\n```\nTo learn more about Data Catalog see [Data Catalog overview](/data-catalog/docs/concepts/overview)\n**Note:** Data Catalog refers to the resources in Vertex AI and in other Cloud services as assets. From now on we'll refer to Vertex AI resources as Vertex AI . The term is used to refer to both the resources and Data Catalog metadata for the .\n", "content": "## Before you begin\n- Enable the Data Catalog API for the project. [Enable the Data Catalog API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=datacatalog.googleapis.com) \n- Check permissions.You need certain Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions to search for and attach tags to Vertex AI assets. For details, see [Required IAM roles and permissions for Data Catalog](#iam-permissions) .## Create tag templates\nTag temples are reusable structures that you can use to rapidly create new tags. Templates help you avoid duplication of work and incomplete tags. Create as many tag templates as you need.\nTo learn more, see [Tags and tag templates](/data-catalog/docs/tags-and-tag-templates) .\n## Attach tags to Vertex AI assets\nAttaching tags to Vertex AI assets lets you do the following:\n- Add business metadata to the assets.\n- Search for assets by business metadata and other custom metadata.\nTo learn more, see [Tags and tag templates](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/tags-and-tag-templates) .\n## Search for Vertex AI assets\nUse the Dataplex search page in the Google Cloud console to search for Vertex AI assets.\n- Go to the Dataplex search page. [Go to Dataplex](https://console.cloud.google.com/dataplex/search) \n- In the **Filters panel** , under **Systems** , select **Vertex AI** .Dataplex displays all known Vertex AI assets.\n- Optional: Do one of the following to narrow down the search:- Use the faceted search on the **Search** page. Select checkboxes under **Data types** , **Projects** , and **Tags** .\n- In the search field, append a search parameter after `system=vertex_ai` . Separate parameters with spaces.For example, to view only models, enter the following text in the search field, and then press `Enter` .```\nsystem=vertex_ai type=model\n```You can also use parentheses and the logical operators `and` and `or` for complex expressions. To learn more about the expressions that you can use in the search field, see [Data Catalog searchsyntax](/data-catalog/docs/how-to/search-reference) .\n- In the results table, click the name of an asset to view the metadata for that asset.\n- Optional: Do any of the following:- Click **ADD OVERVIEW** to add a rich text description of the asset.\n- Click **ATTACH TAGS** to add a tag to the asset.\n## Required IAM roles and permissions for Data Catalog\nViewing, tagging, and searching Vertex AI resources in Data Catalog have different permission requirements.\n### Permission to view public and private tags\nTo get the permissions that you need to view public and private tags on Vertex AI resources, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles:\n- roles/datacatalog.tagTemplateViewer\n- [roles/aiplatform.viewer](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.viewer) \n### Permission to search Vertex AI resources\nTo get the permissions that you need to search Vertex AI resources in Data Catalog, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM role:\n- [roles/aiplatform.user](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.user) \n### Permission to attach tags to Vertex AI resources\nTo get the permissions that you need to attach tags to Vertex AI resources in Data Catalog, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles:\n- [roles/datacatalog.tagTemplateUser](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#datacatalog.tagTemplateUser) \n- [roles/datacatalog.tagEditor](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#datacatalog.tagEditor) \n- [roles/aiplatform.admin](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.admin) \nFor more information, see [Predefined roles](/spanner/docs/iam#roles) .\n## What's next\n- [What is Data Catalog](/data-catalog/docs/concepts/overview) \n- [Roles to search Google Cloud resources](/data-catalog/docs/concepts/iam#roles_to_search_resources)", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
