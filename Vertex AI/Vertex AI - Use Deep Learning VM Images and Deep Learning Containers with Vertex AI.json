All images come with key ML frameworks and tools pre-installed. You can use them out of the box on instances with GPUs to accelerate your data processing tasks.\nDeep Learning VM images are available to support many combinations of framework and processor. There are currently images supporting [TensorFlow Enterprise](/tensorflow-enterprise/docs) , TensorFlow, PyTorch, and generic high-performance computing, with versions for both CPU-only and GPU-enabled workflows.\nTo see a list of frameworks available, see [Choosing animage](/deep-learning-vm/docs/images) .\nTo learn more, see the [Deep Learning VMdocumentation](/deep-learning-vm/docs) .\n### Using Deep Learning VM\nYou can use a Deep Learning VM instance as a part of your work in Vertex AI. For example, you can develop an application to run on a Deep Learning VM instance to take advantage of its optimized data-processing capability. Or use a Deep Learning VM instance as a development environment for a self-managed distributed training system.\nYou can create Deep Learning VM instances on the [Deep Learning VM Cloud Marketplacepage](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/click-to-deploy-images/deeplearning) in the Google Cloud console.\n[Go to the Deep Learning VM Cloud Marketplacepage](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/click-to-deploy-images/deeplearning)\n## Deep Learning Containers\n### Overview\nDeep Learning Containers are a set of Docker containers with key data science frameworks, libraries, and tools pre-installed. These containers provide you with performance-optimized, consistent environments that can help you prototype and implement workflows quickly.\nTo learn more, see the [Deep Learning Containersdocumentation](/deep-learning-containers/docs) .\n### Using Deep Learning Containers\nYou can use a Deep Learning Containers instance as a part of your work in Vertex AI. For example, the [prebuilt containersavailable on Vertex AI](/vertex-ai/docs/training/pre-built-containers) are integrated Deep Learning Containers.\nYou can also build your Vertex AI model as a [custom container](/vertex-ai/docs/training/containers-overview) -based application to help you deploy it in a consistent environment and run it wherever it needs to be.\nTo get started building your own custom container, follow these steps:\n- Choose one of the available [containerimages](/deep-learning-containers/docs/choosing-container) .\n- See the relevant Vertex AI documentation on container requirements, such as [Custom containers fortraining](/vertex-ai/docs/training/containers-overview) and [Custom container requirements forprediction](/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements) .Consider these requirements and prepare to modify your container accordingly.\n- [Create a Deep Learning Containers localinstance](/deep-learning-containers/docs/getting-started-local) , while making sure to modify the container according to Vertex AI requirements.\n- [Push the container toArtifact Registry](/vertex-ai/docs/training/create-custom-container#build-and-push-container) .## What's next\n- Read [Introduction toDeep Learning VM](/deep-learning-vm/docs/introduction) to learn more about the product's features and capabilities.\n- To get started using Deep Learning VM, create a new instance [usingCloud Marketplace](/deep-learning-vm/docs/create-vm-instance-console) or [using the commandline](/ai-platform/deep-learning-vm/docs/create-vm-instance-gcloud) .\n- Read [Deep Learning Containersoverview](/deep-learning-containers/docs/overview) to learn more about the product's features and capabilities.\n- To get started using Deep Learning Containers, [createa local deep learningcontainer](/deep-learning-containers/docs/getting-started-local) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
