This API is required to use Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy). If you already have an existing project with the Vertex AI API enabled, you can use that project instead of creating a new project.## Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) service account\nIn addition to user permissions, Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) acts on your behalf to perform operations such as accessing source data. To do so, Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) uses a Google-managed service account: `service-` `` `@gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com` . By default, the service account grants Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) access to source data in the same project where your featurestore is located. If the source data is in a different project from your featurestore, you must grant the service account permission to access the project where the source data is located.\nFor more information, see [Grant Vertex AI service agents access to otherresources](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#grant_service_agents_access_to_other_resources) .\n## IAM permissions\nVertex AI admins have Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) admin privileges. If you require more granularity, Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) provides a set of predefined IAM roles. These roles provide different sets of permissions that are based on the following personas:\nFor descriptions of each role and their associated permissions, see [Predefined roles forVertex AI](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#predefined-roles) .\n## Quotas and limits\nVertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) enforces quotas and limits to help you manage resources by setting your own usage limits and to protect the community of Google Cloud users by preventing unforeseen spikes in usage. To prevent you from hitting unplanned constraints, review Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) quotas on the [Quotas and limits](/vertex-ai/quotas#featurestore) page. For example, Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) sets a quota on the number of online serving nodes and a quota on the number of online serving requests that you can make per minute.\n## What's next\n- Learn about [Manage featurestores](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/managing-featurestores) .\n- Learn about [best practices](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/best-practices) for using Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy).", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
