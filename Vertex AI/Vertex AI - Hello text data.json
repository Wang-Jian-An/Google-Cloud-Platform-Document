The resulting model classifies happy moments into categories reflecting the causes of happiness.\n**Note:** The data is made available through a Creative Commons [CCO: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.\nTo complete this tutorial, you can either follow the instructions in the following pages or use the in-console walkthrough tutorial, which is a similar tutorial in the Google Cloud console.\n", "content": "## Tutorial pages\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Setting up your project](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl) .\n- [Creating a text classification dataset](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/dataset) .\n- [Training an AutoML text classification model](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/training) .\n- [Deploying the model for batch predictions](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/deploy-predict) .\n- [Cleaning up your project](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/cleanup) .## In-console walkthrough tutorial\nThese two tutorials are available in the Google Cloud console.\nIn Part 1 of the in-console walkthrough tutorial, you'll learn how to build a text classification model using Google's AutoML technology.\nTo follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the Google Cloud console, click **Guide me** :\n[Guide me](https://console.cloud.google.com/?walkthrough_id=vertex_text_classification_part1)\nThis is the second tutorial on building an AutoML text classification model.
