Complete the following steps before using Vertex AI functionality.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the project selector page. [Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard) \n- Select or create a Google Cloud project. **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the  resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of  selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can  delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.\n- [Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#console) .\n- Open [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell-editor) .  Cloud Shell is an interactive shell environment  for Google Cloud that lets you manage your projects and resources from  your web browser.\n- [Go to Cloud Shell](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor) \n- In the Cloud Shell, set the current project to your Google Cloud project ID and store it in the`projectid`shell variable:```\n gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID &&\n projectid=PROJECT_ID &&\n echo $projectid\n```Replacewith your project ID. You can locate your project ID in the Google Cloud console. For more information, see [Find your project ID](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/tabular-bq-prediction/prerequisites#find-project-id) .\n- Enable the IAM, Compute Engine, Notebooks, Cloud Storage, and Vertex AI APIs:```\ngcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com \u00a0compute.googleapis.com notebooks.googleapis.com storage.googleapis.com aiplatform.googleapis.com\n```\n- Grant roles to your Google Account. Run the following command once for each of the following   IAM roles: `roles/aiplatform.user, roles/storage.admin` ```\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member=\"user:EMAIL_ADDRESS\" --role=ROLE\n```- Replace``with your project ID.\n- Replace``with your email address.\n- Replace``with each individual role.- The Vertex AI User (\n- `roles/aiplatform.user`\n- ) IAM role provides access to use all resources in Vertex AI. The\n- [Storage Admin](/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) \n- (\n- `roles/storage.admin`\n- ) role lets you store the document's training dataset in Cloud Storage.\n## What's next\nFollow the [next page of this tutorial](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/dataset) to use the Google Cloud console to create a video classification dataset.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
