[Go to the Feature Store page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/feature-store) \n- In the **Feature groups** section, you can view the list of all the feature groups for the selected location.\nTo retrieve a list of all the [FeatureGroup](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups#resource:-featuregroup) resources for a specific location in your project, send a `GET` request by using the [featureGroups.list](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups/list) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region for which you want to view the list of feature groups, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X GET \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\n$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token$headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $cred\" }Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups\" | Select-Object -Expand Content\n```\nYou should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"featureGroups\": [ {\n  \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME_1\",\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-09-07T00:57:00.142639Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-09-07T00:57:00.142639Z\",\n  \"etag\": \"AMEw9yOY0byP8qKsDY0DoZyouAtX23zDru2l422C0affZZPYNFOGgIrONELNrM49uH4=\",\n  \"bigQuery\": {\n  \"bigQuerySource\": {\n   \"inputUri\": \"BIGQUERY_URI_1\"\n  }\n  }\n },\n {\n  \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME_2\",\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-09-06T23:14:30.795502Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-09-06T23:14:30.795502Z\",\n  \"etag\": \"AMEw9yO5UfrPWobGR2Ry-PnbJUQoklW5lX0uW4JmKqj6OgQui6p-rMdUHfuENpQjbJ3t\",\n  \"bigQuery\": {\n  \"bigQuerySource\": {\n   \"inputUri\": \"BIGQUERY_URI_2\"\n  }\n  }\n }\n ]\n}\n```\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn how to [create a feature](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-feature) .\n- Learn how to [update a feature group](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-featuregroup) .\n- Learn how to [delete a feature group](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/delete-featuregroup) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
