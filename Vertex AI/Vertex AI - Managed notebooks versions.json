On January 30, 2025, support for  managed notebooks will end and the ability to create managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nThis page describes how Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks versions are named and how frequently they are updated.\n", "content": "## Version names\nManaged notebooks version names match the naming convention of [Deep Learning VM Images versions](/deep-learning-vm/docs/images) . Both are named with the letter M followed by a version number. For example, the M93 versions of managed notebooks and Deep Learning VM were released on May 27, 2022.\nManaged notebooks and Deep Learning VM releases that have the same version number also have matching versions of frameworks and pre-installed packages.\nFor example, the M93 version of managed notebooks contains a TensorFlow kernel that runs TensorFlow 2.9, and the M93 version of Deep Learning VM includes an image with a TensorFlow 2.9 environment.\n## Update frequency\nManaged notebooks versions are not necessarily updated at the same time as Deep Learning VM. For example, the M91 version of managed notebooks was released after the M91 version of Deep Learning VM.\nManaged notebooks versions are not necessarily updated as frequently as Deep Learning VM. As a result, managed notebooks versions can skip version numbers. For example, Deep Learning VM released versions M91, M92, and M93, while managed notebooks released versions M91 and M93.\n## What's next\n- Browse the [Vertex AI release notes](/vertex-ai/docs/release-notes) , which include the release notes for Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks.\n- Browse the [Deep Learning VMrelease notes](/deep-learning-vm/docs/release-notes) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
