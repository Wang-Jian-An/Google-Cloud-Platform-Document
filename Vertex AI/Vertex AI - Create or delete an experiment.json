{"title": "Vertex AI - Create or delete an experiment", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform", "abstract": "# Vertex AI - Create or delete an experiment\nYou can use either the Vertex AI SDK for Python or the Google Cloud console to create or delete an experiment. The SDK is a library of Python code that you can use to programmatically create and manage experiments. The console is a web-based user interface that you can use to create and manage experiments visually.\nWhen creating an experiment using the Google Cloud console for the first time, be sure that there's a`default`Metadata Store. To check, go to your project's **Metadata** page in the Google Cloud console. See [Configure your project's metadata store](/vertex-ai/docs/ml-metadata/configure)\n", "content": "## Create experiment with a TensorBoard instance\nCreate an experiment and, optionally, associate a Vertex AI TensorBoard instance using the Vertex AI SDK for Python. Add a description for the experiment to document its purpose. See [init](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/google.cloud.aiplatform#google_cloud_aiplatform_init) in the Vertex AI SDK reference documentation. ### Python [View on GitHub](https://github.com/googleapis/python-aiplatform/blob/HEAD/samples/model-builder/experiment_tracking/create_experiment_sample.py) \n```\ndef create_experiment_sample(\u00a0 \u00a0 experiment_name: str,\u00a0 \u00a0 experiment_description: str,\u00a0 \u00a0 experiment_tensorboard: Optional[Union[str, aiplatform.Tensorboard]],\u00a0 \u00a0 project: str,\u00a0 \u00a0 location: str,):\u00a0 \u00a0 aiplatform.init(\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 experiment=experiment_name,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 experiment_description=experiment_description,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 experiment_tensorboard=experiment_tensorboard,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 project=project,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 location=location,\u00a0 \u00a0 )\n```\n- `experiment_name`: Provide a name for your experiment.\n- `experiment_description`: Provide a description for your experiment.\n- `experiment_tensorboard`:    Optional. The Vertex TensorBoard instance to use    as a backing TensorBoard for the provided experiment.    If no`experiment_tensorboard`is provided, a default TB instance is    created and used by this experiment. Note: If CMEK (encryption keys) need to be    associated with the TensorBoard instance, then`experiment_tensorboard`is no longer optional.\n- `project`: Your [project ID](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifiers) .

[Go to Experiments](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/experiments) \n- Be sure you're in the project you want to create the experiment in.\n- Click **add_box\n  Create** to open the **Experiment** pane. The **Create experiment** pane appears.\n- In the **Experiment name** field, provide a name to uniquely identify your experiment.\n- Optional. In the **TensorBoard instance** field, select an instance from the drop-down or   provide a name for your new TensorBoard instance.\n- Click **Create** to create your experiment.## Create an experiment without a default TensorBoard instance\nCreate an experiment. Add a description for the experiment to document its purpose.

The Vertex AI TensorBoard experiment associated with the experiment is not deleted. To delete a TensorBoard experiment, see [Delete outdated Vertex AI TensorBoard experiment](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/user-journey/uj-delete-outdated-tb-experiments) .\nAlso, any pipeline runs, artifacts, and executions associated with the deleted experiment are not removed. These can be found in the Google Cloud console. For artifacts and executions, a $10/GB monthly charge is handled by the Vertex ML Metadata service.\nThe following sample uses the [delete](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/google.cloud.aiplatform.ExperimentRun#google_cloud_aiplatform_ExperimentRun_delete) method from the [ExperimentClass](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/google.cloud.aiplatform.ExperimentRun) .### Python [View on GitHub](https://github.com/googleapis/python-aiplatform/blob/HEAD/samples/model-builder/experiment_tracking/delete_experiment_sample.py) \n```\ndef delete_experiment_sample(\u00a0 \u00a0 experiment_name: str,\u00a0 \u00a0 project: str,\u00a0 \u00a0 location: str,\u00a0 \u00a0 delete_backing_tensorboard_runs: bool = False,):\u00a0 \u00a0 experiment = aiplatform.Experiment(\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 experiment_name=experiment_name, project=project, location=location\u00a0 \u00a0 )\u00a0 \u00a0 experiment.delete(delete_backing_tensorboard_runs=delete_backing_tensorboard_runs)\n```\n- `experiment_name`: Provide a name for your experiment.\n- `project`: Your [project ID](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifiers) . You can find these IDs in the Google Cloud console [welcome](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome) page.\n- `location`: See [List of available locations](/vertex-ai/docs/general/locations) \n- `delete_backing_tensorboard_runs`: If True will also delete the   Vertex AI TensorBoard runs associated with the experiment     runs under this experiment that we used to store time series metrics.\nUse the following instructions to delete an experiment.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Experiments** page. [Go to Experiments](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/experiments) \n- Select the checkbox associated with the experiment you want to delete. The **Delete** option appears.\n- Click **Delete** .- Alternatively, you can go to themore_vertoptions  menu that is in the same row as the experiment and select **delete** .\n## View list of experiments in Google Cloud console\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Experiments** page. [Go to the Experiments page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/experiments) \n- Check to be sure you are in the correct project.\n- A list of experiments for your project appears in the **Experiment tracking** view. If you associated a Vertex AI TensorBoard instance with your experiment it shows up in the list as \" Backing TensorBoard Experiment\".\n## What's next\n- [Create and manage experiment runs](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/create-manage-exp-run) \n- [Delete outdated Vertex AI TensorBoard experiment](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/user-journey/uj-delete-outdated-tb-experiments) \n### Relevant notebook sample\n- [Model training with prebuilt data pre-processing code](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/user-journey/uj-model-training)", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
