The following Vertex AI Feature Store resources are categorized as as data types in the Dataplex search filter:\n- `FeatureOnlineStore`\n- `FeatureView` **Note:** If your project name contains `:` , Dataplex doesn't catalog `FeatureView` and `Feature` resources created in the project.\n- `FeatureGroup`\nNote that `Feature` is not listed as a data type in the search filters. However, you can view the list of features and feature metadata by viewing the metadata of the parent feature groups.\n## IAM permissions required\nUsing the Dataplex search, you can view Vertex AI Feature Store resources if you have the IAM permissions to view those Vertex AI Feature Store resources in your Google Cloud project. You don't need additional permissions for viewing the resource metadata in Data Catalog.\n**Note:** If you have the permission to view a feature group, you can view the features, including feature metadata, within that feature group using Data Catalog.\n## View metadata for an online store\nTo search for a [FeatureOnlineStore](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores#resource:-featureOnlineStore) resource, follow these steps:\n- To launch a Dataplex search query in the Google Cloud console, go to the **Dataplex Search** page.
