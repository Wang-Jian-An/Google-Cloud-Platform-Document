On January 30, 2025, support for  user-managed notebooks will end and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nAfter you create a user-managed notebooks instance, you might need to install software that your notebook depends on. You can install dependencies by adding install commands to a file in your notebook or by using a terminal window.\nAn advantage of adding install commands to a file is that, when you share a notebook, the commands to install the dependencies are saved with the notebook and are available to users that you share the notebook with.\n", "content": "## Install dependencies from a user-managed notebooks instance\nTo install Python packages from a user-managed notebooks instance:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **User-managed notebooks** page. [Go to User-managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed) \n- Select the instance where you want to install dependencies.\n- Click **Open JupyterLab** .\n- To add a notebook file, you can use the menu or the Launcher.\n- To add a new notebook file from the menu, select **File\u00a0> New\u00a0> Notebook** . \n- In the **Select kernel** dialog, select the kernel for your new notebook, for example, **Python 3** , and then click **Select** .Your new notebook file opens.\n- To add a new Python 3 notebook file from the Launcher, select **File\u00a0> New\u00a0> Launcher** .\n- Click the **Python 3** tile. Your new notebook file opens.- Rename your new notebook file.\n- Select **File\u00a0> Rename notebook** . The **Rename file** dialog opens.\n- In the **New name** field, change `Untitled.ipynb` to something meaningful, such as `install.ipynb` .\n- Click **Rename** .\n- Right-click the `Untitled.ipynb` tab and then click **Rename notebook** . The **Rename file** dialog opens.\n- In the **New name** field, change `Untitled.ipynb` to something meaningful, such as `install.ipynb` .\n- Click **Rename** .- Install dependencies as follows.When you open your new notebook, there is a default code cell where you can enter code, in this case Python 3.To install the [mxnet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) deep learning library in a Python 3 notebook, enter the following command in the code cell:`%pip install mxnet` \n- Click the run button to run the install command. \n- When installation is complete, select **Kernel\u00a0> Restart kernel** to restart the kernel and ensure the library is available for import.\n- Select **File\u00a0> Save notebook** to save the notebook.## Install dependencies from a terminal\nTo connect to a terminal, you can use your JupyterLab notebook or [SSH](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/ssh-access) . To install Python packages from a terminal:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **User-managed notebooks** page. [Go to User-managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed) \n- Select the instance where you want to install dependencies.\n- Click **Open JupyterLab** .\n- To open a terminal window, you can use the menu or the Launcher.\nTo open a terminal window from the menu, select **File\u00a0> New\u00a0> Terminal** .\n \nThe terminal window opens.- To open a terminal window from the Launcher, select **File\u00a0> New\u00a0> Launcher** .\n- In **Other** , click the **Terminal** tile. The terminal window opens.- In the terminal window, enter the command to install the software dependency for your user-managed notebooks instance.To install the [mxnet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) deep learning library for Python 3 notebooks, enter the following command:`pip3 install mxnet` \n- When installation is complete, restart the kernel to make sure the library is available for import. In every open notebook file in the same user-managed notebooks instance, select **Kernel\u00a0> Restart kernel** .\n- Select **File\u00a0> Save notebook** to save the notebook.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
