On January 30, 2025, support for  managed notebooks will end and the ability to create managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nThis page describes common ways to develop a machine learning (ML) model in Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks. You can use pre-installed Python packages that are commonly used for ML model development, Vertex AI custom training, and BigQuery ML.\n#", "content": "## Common Python packages\nBy default, managed notebooks instances are pre-installed with Python packages that are commonly used for model development. Import these packages into your notebook file and they are ready to use.\n### Vertex AI custom training\nYou can use [Vertex AI custom training](/vertex-ai/docs/training/overview) to create and train models from within your managed notebooks instance.\n[Install one of the Vertex AIclient libraries](/vertex-ai/docs/start/client-libraries) on your instance, or use the [Vertex AI API](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest) to send API requests from a Jupyter notebook file.\nTo see an example of how to use the Vertex AI SDK for Python to train and deploy a custom image classification model for online prediction,  run the \"Custom training and online prediction\" Jupyter notebook in one of the following  environments: [Openin Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/deploy-managed-notebook?download_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FGoogleCloudPlatform%2Fvertex-ai-samples%2Fmain%2Fnotebooks%2Fofficial%2Fcustom%2Fsdk-custom-image-classification-online.ipynb) | [Openin Colab Enterprise](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/import/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FGoogleCloudPlatform%2Fvertex-ai-samples%2Fmain%2Fnotebooks%2Fofficial%2Fcustom%2Fsdk-custom-image-classification-online.ipynb) | [View on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/custom/sdk-custom-image-classification-online.ipynb)\n### BigQuery ML\nUsing [BigQuery ML](/bigquery-ml/docs) , you can train models that use your BigQuery data, all from within your managed notebooks instance. For example, by using the [Python client forBigQuery](/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest) , you can send SQL commands from your notebook file to create a model, and then use the model to get batch predictions.\nBigQuery ML leverages the BigQuery computational engine, so you don't need to deploy the compute resources required for batch predictions or model training. This can reduce the time it takes to set up training, evaluation, and prediction.\n## What's next\n- To learn more about Vertex AI custom training, see [Understand the custom training service](/vertex-ai/docs/training/understanding-training-service) .\n- To learn more about BigQuery ML, see [What is BigQuery ML?](/bigquery-ml/docs/introduction)", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
