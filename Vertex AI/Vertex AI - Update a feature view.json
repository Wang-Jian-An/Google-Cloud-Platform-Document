Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nYou can update a feature view to modify the list of feature data sources associated with it. For example, you might want to make the following updates:\n- Associate a different feature group and features, or a different set of features from the same feature group.\n- Specify a BigQuery table or view containing the feature data. Note that in this case, you need to specify one or more entity ID columns.\nWhile creating or updating a feature view, you have the option to add user-defined metadata in the form of labels to the feature view. For more information about how to update user-defined labels for a feature view, see [Update labels for a feature view](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/feature-labels#feature_view) .\n", "content": "## Update a feature view based on feature group\nUse the following sample to update a feature view by specifying features from an existing feature group.\nTo update a [FeatureView](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews#resource:-featureView) resource, send a `PATCH` request by using the [featureViews.patch](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews/patch) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the online store is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the online store containing the feature view.\n- : The name of the feature view you want to delete.\n- : The name of the feature group you want to associate with the feature view.\n- and: Feature IDs that you want to add to the feature view from  thefeature group.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPATCH https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews/FEATUREVIEW_NAME\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"feature_registry_source\":\n { \"feature_groups\": [  {\n  \"feature_group_id\": \"FEATUREGROUP_NAME\",\n  \"feature_ids\": [ \"FEATURE_ID_1\", \"FEATURE_ID_2\" ]\n  }\n ]\n }\n}\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.
