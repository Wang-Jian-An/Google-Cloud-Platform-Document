Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nData sync is the process of refreshing or synchronizing the data in a feature view within an online store from the feature data source in BigQuery. To sync the data for the entire online store, you need to sync the data for all of its feature views.\nThere are two ways in which the data sync occurs for a feature view:\n- **Scheduled data sync** : The feature data is automatically refreshed, based on the sync schedule configured for the feature view using the [FeatureView.sync_config](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews#FeatureView.FIELDS.sync_config) parameter.\n- **Manual data sync** : You can skip the wait between two scheduled data sync operations by manually initiating the data sync for a feature view.\nData sync might involve costs for BigQuery resource usage. For information about how to optimize costs while setting the sync schedule for a feature view, see [Optimize costs during sync](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featureview#sync_optimize_costs) .\n", "content": "## Manually start a data sync\nUse the following sample to manually start the data sync in a feature view. Note that only one data sync operation can be active at any point of time for a feature view. If you try to manually start the data sync while another sync is in progress, then the new sync operation starts only after the ongoing sync operation ends.\nTo manually start a data sync in a [FeatureView](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews#resource:-featureView) , send a `POST` request by using the [featureViews.sync](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews/sync) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the online store is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the online store containing the feature view.\n- : The name of the feature view where you want to manually start the data sync.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPOST https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews/FEATUREVIEW_NAME:sync\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X POST \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\" \\ -d \"\" \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews/FEATUREVIEW_NAME:sync\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\n$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token$headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $cred\" }Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews/FEATUREVIEW_NAME:sync\" | Select-Object -Expand Content\n```\nYou should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"featureViewSync\": \"projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureOnlineStores/FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME/featureViews/FEATUREVIEW_NAME/featureViewSyncs/OPERATION_ID\"\n}\n```\n## What's next\n- Learn how to [view a list of all data sync operations executed for a feature view](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/list-data-syncs) .\n- Learn how to [update a feature view](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-featureview)", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
