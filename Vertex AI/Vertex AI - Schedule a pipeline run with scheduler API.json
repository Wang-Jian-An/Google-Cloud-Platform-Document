{"title": "Vertex AI - Schedule a pipeline run with scheduler API", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform", "abstract": "# Vertex AI - Schedule a pipeline run with scheduler API\nYou can schedule one-time or recurring pipeline runs in Vertex AI using the scheduler API. This lets you implement continuous training in your project.\nAfter you create a schedule, it can have one of the following states:\n- `ACTIVE` : An active schedule continuously creates pipeline runs according to the frequency configured using the cron schedule expression. A schedule becomes active on its start time and remains in that state until the specified end time, or until you pause it.\n- `PAUSED` : A paused schedule doesn't create pipeline runs. You can resume a paused schedule to make it active again. When you resume a paused schedule, you can use the `catch_up` parameter to specify whether skipped runs (runs that would have been scheduled if the schedule had been active) need to be rescheduled and submitted at the earliest possible schedule.\n- `COMPLETED` : A completed schedule no longer creates new pipeline runs. A schedule is completed according to its specified end time.\nYou can use the scheduler API to do the following:\n- [Create a schedule](#create-a-schedule) \n- [List schedules](#list-schedules) \n- [Retrieve a schedule](#retrieve-schedule) \n- [Pause a schedule](#pause-schedule) \n- [Update a schedule](#update-schedule) \n- [Resume a schedule](#resume-schedule) \n- [Delete a schedule](#delete-schedule) ", "content": "## Before you begin\nBefore you schedule a pipeline run using the scheduler API, use the following instructions to set up your Google Cloud project and development environment in the Google Cloud console.\n- Grant the at least one of the following IAM permissions to the user or service account for using the scheduler API:- `roles/aiplatform.admin`\n- `roles/aiplatform.user`\n- Build and compile a pipeline. For more information, see [Build a Pipeline](/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/build-pipeline) .## Create a schedule\nYou can create a one-time or recurring schedule.\nUse the following instructions to create a schedule using the Google Cloud console. If a schedule already exists for the project and region, use the instructions in [Create a pipeline run](/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/run-pipeline#create_a_pipeline_run) .\nUse the following instructions to create a pipeline schedule:- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Schedules** tab on the **Pipelines** page. [Go to Schedules](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pipelines/schedules) \n- Click **Create scheduled run** to open the **Create pipeline run** pane.\n- Specify the following **Run details** by selecting one of the following options:- To create a pipeline run based on an existing pipeline template, click **Select from existing pipelines** and enter the following details:- Select the **Repository** containing the pipeline or component definition file.\n- Select the **Pipeline or component** and **Version** .\n- To upload a compiled pipeline definition, click **Upload file** and enter the following details:- Click **Browse** to open the file selector. Navigate to the compiled pipeline YAML file that you want to run, select the pipeline, and click **Open** .\n- The **Pipeline or component name** shows the name specified in the pipeline definition, by default. Optionally, specify a different Pipeline name.\n- To import a pipeline definition file from Cloud Storage, click **Import from Cloud Storage** and enter the following details:- Click **Browse** to navigate to the Cloud Storage bucket containing the pipeline definition object, select the file, and then click **Select** .\n- Specify the **Pipeline or component name** .\n- Specify a **Run name** to uniquely identify the pipeline run.\n- Specify the **Run schedule** , as follows:- Select **Recurring** .\n- Under **Start time** , specify the when the schedule becomes active.- To schedule the first run to occur immediately upon schedule creation, select **Immediately** .\n- To schedule the first run to occur at a specific time and date, select **On** .\n- In the **Frequency** field, specify the frequency to schedule and execute the pipeline runs, using a cron schedule expression based on [unix-cron](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html) .\n- Under **Ends** , specify when the schedule ends.- To indicate that the schedule creates pipeline runs indefinitely, select **Never** .\n- To indicate that the schedule ends on a specific date and time, select **On** , and specify the end date and time for the schedule.\n- Optional: To specify a custom service account, a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK), or a peered VPC network, click **Advanced options** and specify a service account, CMEK, or peered VPC network name.\n- Click **Continue** and specify the **Runtime configuration** for the pipeline.\n- Click **Submit** to create your pipeline run schedule.To create a pipeline run schedule, send a POST request by using the [projects.locations.schedules.create](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.schedules/create) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : The region where you want to run the pipeline. For more information  about the regions where Vertex AI Pipelines is available, see the [Vertex AI locations guide](/vertex-ai/docs/general/locations#feature-availability) .\n- : The Google Cloud project where you want to run the pipeline.\n- : The name of the pipeline schedule. You can specify a name having  a maximum length of 128 UTF-8 characters.\n- : Timestamp after which the first run can be scheduled, for example,`2045-07-26T00:00:00Z`. If you don't specify this parameter, the timestamp  corresponding to the date and time when you create the schedule is used as the default  value.\n- : Timestamp after which pipeline runs are no longer scheduled scheduled.  After theis reached, the state of the schedule changes to`COMPLETED`. If you don't specify this parameter, then the schedule continues to run  new pipeline jobs indefinitely until you pause or delete the schedule.\n- : Cron schedule expression representing the frequency to  schedule and execute pipeline runs. For more information, see [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) .\n- : The maximum number of concurrent runs for the schedule.\n- :`PipelineService.CreatePipelineJob`API request  template used to execute the scheduled pipeline runs.
