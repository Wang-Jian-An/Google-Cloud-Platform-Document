This page also describes how to rename, upload, and delete a notebook.", "content": "## Before you begin### Required rolesTo ensure that your user account has the necessary  permissions to create a Colab Enterprise notebook and run the notebook's code on a runtime,   ask your administrator to grant your user account the   Colab Enterprise User ( [roles/aiplatform.colabEnterpriseUser](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.colabEnterpriseUser) ) IAM role on the project.    For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nYour administrator might also be able to give your user account  the required permissions through [custom  roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined  roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\nUsers assigned the Code Creator role in a project can list the names of code assets in that project by using the Dataform API or the Dataform command-line interface (CLI). In preview, non-administrators using BigQuery Studio can only see code assets that they created or that were shared with them.## Create a notebookTo create a Colab Enterprise notebook by using the Google Cloud console:- In the Google Cloud console, go to  the Colab Enterprise **Notebooks** page. [Go to Notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/notebooks) \n- In the **Region** menu, select the region where you want to  create your notebook.\n- Next to **Files** ,  click add_box **Create a notebook** .Your new notebook appears on the **My notebooks** tab.\nWhen you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see [Clean up](#clean-up) .## Run code in a default runtimeTo run a Colab Enterprise notebook's code on the default runtime, do the following:- In the Google Cloud console, go to  the Colab Enterprise **Notebooks** page. [Go to Notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/notebooks) \n- In the **Region** menu, select the region that contains your notebook.\n- On the **My notebooks** tab, click the notebook  that you want to open.\n- Hold the pointer over the code cell that you want to run,  and then click the **Run cell** button.\n- If this is your first time connecting to a runtime with  end-user credentials enabled, a **Sign in** dialog appears.The default runtime has end-user credentials enabled to make it easier  to [run code that interacts with Google Cloud](/colab/docs/run-code-adc) .To grant Colab Enterprise access to your user credentials, complete the following steps:- In the **Sign in** dialog, click your user account.\n- Select **See, edit, configure, and delete your  Google Cloud data...** to grant Colab Enterprise  access to your user credentials.\n- Click **Continue** .\nAfter your runtime starts, Colab Enterprise connects to the runtime and runs the code in the cell.## Rename your notebookTo rename a Colab Enterprise notebook:- In the Google Cloud console, go to  the Colab Enterprise **Notebooks** page. [Go to Notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/notebooks) \n- In the **Region** menu, select the region that contains your notebook.\n- Next to the notebook that you want to rename, click the more_vert **Actions** menu,  and then select **Rename** .\n- In the **Rename notebook** dialog,  change the name of the notebook, and then click **Rename** .\n## Upload a notebookTo upload a notebook to Colab Enterprise:- In the Google Cloud console, go to  the Colab Enterprise **Notebooks** page. [Go to Notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/notebooks) \n- In the **Region** menu, select the region where you want to  upload your notebook.\n- Next to **Files** ,  click upload **Upload notebook file** .\n- In the **Upload notebook** dialog, in the **Select notebook** field, click **Browse** and select the notebook that you want to upload.The notebook must be fewer than 20\u00a0MB.\n- Optional: In the **Notebook name** field, edit the name of  the notebook file.\n- Click **Upload** .Your notebook appears on the **My notebooks** tab.\n## Clean upTo avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for   the resources used on this page, follow these steps.\nTo avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and delete the individual resources.\n## What's next\n- Read the [Introduction toColab Enterprise](/colab/docs/introduction) .\n- [Connect to a runtime](/colab/docs/connect-to-runtime) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
