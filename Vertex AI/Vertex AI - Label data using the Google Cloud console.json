You can also delete or add new labels to existing labeled datasets.\nTo learn how to import your data, see the page of the data type and objective that you're working with on [Training overview](/vertex-ai/docs/training-overview#automl) .\nAfter [creating the dataset](/vertex-ai/docs/datasets/create-dataset-console#create-import) and importing the unlabeled data, you will be in **Browse** mode.\n", "content": "## How to add labels\nInstructions for labeling objectives are provided here for each data type.\nThe images you have just imported in the dataset are unlabeled, as expected.When in Browse mode, and the dataset with the unlabeled images is selected, you can see   your uploaded images.- Click **Add new label** and enter your new label.\n- Click **Done** .Repeat for each label you want to add.\n- Select the image you want to label.The list of labels appears.\n- Select the label you want to associate with the image.\n- Click **Save** .\nWhen in **Browse** mode, and the dataset with the unlabeled images is selected, you   can see your uploaded images.- Click **Add new label** and enter your new label.\n- Click **Done** .Repeat for each label you want to add.\n- Select the image you want to label.The list of labels appears.\n- Select the label you want to associate with the image.\n- Click **Save** .\n- You can view the labels applied to each image in the **Browse** tab.\nWhen in **Browse** mode, and the dataset with the unlabeled images is selected, you   can see your uploaded images.- Click **Add new label** and enter your new label.\n- Click **Done** .Repeat for each label you want to add.\n- Select the image you want to label.\n- The list of labels objects appears, if there are any.\n- In the add annotation window, select the Add bounding box button to add an object   bounding box to the image.\n- After drawing a bounding box, a list of labels to apply to the object will appear.   Choose the appropriate label.\n- After you have added all labels and bounding boxes, click **Save** to update the   image's annotations.The text you have just imported in the dataset may or may not be labeled.\n- Click the text to label.\n- To add a new label, click **Add label** .\n- For a single-label classification dataset, select one label to associate with the text.You can delete labels, as well.\n- Click **Save** .\n- Click the text to label.\n- To add a new label, click **Add label** .\n- For multi-label classification datasets, select one or more labels   to associate with the text.You can delete labels, as well.\n- Click **Save** .\n- Click the text to label.\n- To add a new label, click **Add label** .\n- Select one or more words to label.\n- Select a label to associate with the selected text.\n- Click **Save** .\n- Click the text to label.\n- To add a new label, click **Add label** .\n- Select a score to associate with the text.\n- Click **Save** .The videos you have imported in the dataset are unlabeled, as expected.- To navigate to your new dataset, click \"Datasets\" in the navigation menu.\n- Select the dataset you want to add labels to.Dataset appears.\nWhen in **Browse** mode, and the dataset with the unlabeled videos is selected, you   should see your videos. - Add label(s).\n- Select a video and start viewing.\n- When the action starts appearing that you want to identify, slowly   progress through till you find the center or the most representative moment of the action   using \"Next frame\" option.\n- Click **Add annotation** .Your list of labels appears.\n- Select the label you want for this video segment.\n- Click **Save** .\nWhen the dataset with the unlabeled videos is selected, you   will see your videos. - Add labels.\n- Select the video you want to label. The video appears with your list of color-coded   labels below.\n- Navigate to starting point of segment. Click **Add segment** .- Select segment. Adjust    to designate the segment to be used for training for your particular label:\n- Select label. You can select multiple labels for a segment.\n- Click **Done** , then **Save** .\n- Repeat steps to add another label to the same video with a different time segment.    Here's an example of where two more labels were added:\n- Return to **Datasets** list to repeat.\nWhen in **BROWSE** mode, and the dataset with the unlabeled videos is selected, you   should see your videos. - Click **Add Label** and add the labels you plan to use (for example, \"sedan\",   \"pickup\", \"SUV\").\n- Click **Save** . If you need to add more labels later, click **Add new label** and **Save** .\n- Select a video and start viewing.\n- When an object appears that you want to track,- Stop the video.\n- Drag a bounding box from the upper left corner, down to the lower right corner.    Be sure to make the box as tight as possible around the object.A list of labels appears to the lower right-hand side of the bounding box.\n- Select the appropriate label. **Note:** Note: You can always add more labels during this process. Be sure to    save the added label so it shows up in the list going forward.\n- Click **Save** .\n## What's next\n- [Training your AutoML model using the Google Cloud console](/vertex-ai/docs/training/automl-console) .\n- [Training your AutoML Edge model using the Google Cloud console](/vertex-ai/docs/training/automl-edge-console) .
