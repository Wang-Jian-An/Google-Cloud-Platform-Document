You can use these classes to generate text, create a text or code chatbot, tune a foundation model, and create a text embedding. A text embedding is text in the form of a vector used to search for items. For more information, see [Introduction to language model classes in the Vertex AI SDK](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/sdk-for-llm/llm-sdk-overview) .\nYou can use the Vertex AI SDK for Python in a hosted JupyterLab notebooks within Vertex AI to write and run your code. The notebooks include preinstalled ML frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. You can also use other notebooks, such as Colab notebooks, or use a developer environment of your choice that supports Python.\nIf you want to try using the Vertex AI SDK for Python right now, see the following resources:\n- [Introduction to the Vertex AI SDK for Python](/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/use-vertex-ai-python-sdk) \n- [Vertex AI SDK reference](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/google.cloud.aiplatform) \n- [Vertex AI SDK language model reference](/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/vertexai.language_models) \n- [Train a model using Vertex AI and the Python SDK](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/tabular-bq-prediction) \nThe Vertex AI SDK includes many classes to help you automate data ingestion, train models, and get predictions. It also includes classes to help you monitor, evaluate, and optimize your machine learning (ML) workflow. The classes can be loosely grouped into the following categories:\n- [Data classes](/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/data-classes) include classes that work with structured data, unstructured data, and the Vertex AI Feature Store.\n- [Training classes](/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/training-classes) include classes that work with AutoML training for structured and unstructured data, custom training, hyperparameter training, and pipeline training.\n- [Model classes](/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/model-classes) work with models and model evaluations.\n- [Prediction classes](/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/prediction-classes) work with batch predictions, online predictions, and Vector Search predictions.\n- [Tracking classes](/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/tracking-classes) work with Vertex ML Metadata, Vertex AI Experiments, and Vertex AI TensorBoard", "content": ".", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
