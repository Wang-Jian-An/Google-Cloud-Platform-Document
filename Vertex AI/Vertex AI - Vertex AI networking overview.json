{"title": "Vertex AI - Vertex AI networking overview", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/netsec-overview", "abstract": "# Vertex AI - Vertex AI networking overview\nVertex AI supports enterprise networking options for accessing Vertex AI endpoints and services that help you:\n- Safely access your Vertex AI resources from an on-premises or multicloud environment.\n- Protect your Vertex AI artifacts from exfiltration.\n- Configure network traffic for your Vertex AI resources.\nThis page is intended for enterprise networking architects and administrators who are already familiar with Google Cloud networking concepts.\n", "content": "## Public access for Vertex AI\nVertex AI services that are accessible from the internet have a checkmark in the **Public internet** column of the [Private access options for Vertex AI](/vertex-ai/docs/general/netsec-overview#private_access_options_for) table. The APIs for these services resolve to the fully qualified domain name `` `-aiplatform.googleapis.com` , which returns publicly routable IP addresses.\n## Private access options for Vertex AI\nVertex AI supports the following options for accessing Vertex AI endpoints and services privately, without assigning external IP addresses to your Google Cloud resources:\n- [Private Service Connect endpoints for Google APIs](/vertex-ai/docs/general/googleapi-access-methods#psc) let your Google Cloud resources or on-premises systems connect to an endpoint in your VPC network, which forwards requests to Google APIs and services.\n- [Private Google Access](/vertex-ai/docs/general/googleapi-access-methods#pga) :- Lets your Google Cloud resources connect to the [standardexternal IP addresses or Private Google Accessdomains and virtual IP (VIP) addresses](/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access#config) for Google APIs and services through the VPC network's default internet gateway.\n- Lets your on-premises hosts connect to Google APIs and services through a Cloud VPN tunnel or VLAN attachment by using one of the [Private Google Access-specific domains and VIPs](/vpc/docs/private-google-access-hybrid#private-vips) .\n- [Private services access](/vertex-ai/docs/general/private-services-access) :- Lets your Google Cloud VM instances connect to Google-managed Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) in the service producer's VPC network through an endpoint.\n- Lets your on-premises hosts connect to the service producer through hybrid networking, for example, by using a Cloud VPN tunnel or VLAN attachment once the private service access subnet is advertised from the Cloud Router.\n- Lets your Google Cloud VM instances connect to a Google or third-party managed VPC network through a VPC Network Peering connection.\n- [Private Service Connect endpoints](/vertex-ai/docs/general/psc-endpoints) lets your Google Cloud VM instances connect to services in another VPC network through an endpoint.## Accessing Vertex AI from on-premises and multicloud\nThe following table shows the supported access methods for connecting from on-premises and multicloud environments to Vertex AI services. In this table, a checkmark indicates that an access method is supported.
