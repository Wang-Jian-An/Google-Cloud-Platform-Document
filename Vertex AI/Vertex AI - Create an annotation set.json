Annotation sets are associated with a data type and model objective (for example, `video/classification` ). You create annotation sets for image, text, and video data types.\nTo learn how to apply the labels of your annotation set to your dataset's data, see [Label using the Google Cloud console](/vertex-ai/docs/datasets/label-using-console) .\n", "content": "## How to create an annotation set\nWhen you create a dataset in Vertex AI, if the imported CSV or [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) file contains labels, Vertex AI automatically creates an annotation set and assigns it the objective that you selected for the dataset. For example, if you select as the data type and as the objective, the annotation set `` `\\_vcn` is created, where \"vcn\" stands for \"video classification.\"\nIf the dataset is already created and you want to add an annotation set or additional annotation sets, you can create them in the Google Cloud console as detailed in the following section.\n## Create a new annotation set\nYou can create a new annotation set for an existing dataset in the Google Cloud console only.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the Vertex AI **Datasets** page. [Go to Datasets](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/datasets) \n- Click the dataset that you want to create an annotation set for.The dataset appears.\n- In the selector box next to the name of your dataset, select **Create annotation set** .\n- In the **Create annotation set** pane, enter a name for the annotation set.\n- Select the model objective.\n- Click **Create** .The dataset view appears with your new annotation set displayed. You are now ready to apply the labels of your new annotation set to your data.## What's next\n- Edit, or add labels to your dataset [using the Google Cloud console](/vertex-ai/docs/datasets/label-using-console) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
