The first step is to create an `IndexEndpoint` . You can deploy more than one index to an `IndexEndpoint` that shares the same VPC network.\nThe following example uses the [gcloud ai index-endpoints create](/sdk/gcloud/reference/ai/index-endpoints/create) command.\nBefore using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:- : Display name of the index endpoint.\n- : The Google Compute Engine network name to which the index endpoint should be peered.\n- : The region where you are using Vertex AI.\n- : Your Google Cloud [project ID](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifiers) .\nExecute the  following  command:\nYou should receive a response similar to the following:\n```\nThe Google Cloud CLI tool might take a few minutes to create the IndexEndpoint.\n```\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Display name of the index endpoint.\n- : The Google Compute Engine network name to which the index endpoint should be peered.\n- : The region where you are using Vertex AI.\n- : Your Google Cloud [project ID](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifiers) .\n- : Your project's automatically generated [project number](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifiers) .\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPOST https://LOCATION-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/indexEndpoints\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"display_name\": \"INDEX_ENDPOINT_NAME\",\n \"network\": \"VPC_NETWORK_NAME\"\n}\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION/indexEndpoints/INDEX_ENDPOINT_ID/operations/OPERATION_ID\",\n \"metadata\": {\n \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.CreateIndexEndpointOperationMetadata\",\n \"genericMetadata\": {\n  \"createTime\": \"2022-01-13T04:09:56.641107Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2022-01-13T04:09:56.641107Z\"\n }\n }\n}\n```\nYou can poll for the status of the operation until the response includes `\"done\": true` .Use these instructions to create an index endpoint.- In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to  the **Deploy and Use** section. Select **Vector Search** [Go to  Vector Search](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/matching-engine/indexes) \n- A list of your active indexes is displayed.\n- On the top of the page, select the **Index endpoints** tab. Your index endpoints are displayed.\n- Click **add_boxCreate new index endpoint** . The Create a new index endpoint panel opens.\n- Enter a display name for the index endpoint.\n- In the **Region** field, select a region from the drop-down.\n- In the **Access** field, select **Private** .\n- Enter your peered VPC network details. Enter the full name of the  Compute Engine network to which the job should be peered. The format should be`projects/{project_num}/global/networks/{network_id}`\n- Click **Create** .## Deploy an index\n**Important:** Initial deployment to an endpoint typically takes between 20 and 30 minutes.\nThis example uses the [gcloud ai index-endpoints deploy-indexcommand](/sdk/gcloud/reference/ai/index-endpoints/deploy-index) .\nBefore using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:- : The ID of the index endpoint.\n- : A user specified string to uniquely identify the deployed index. It must start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers or underscores.

Select **Vector Search** [Go to  Vector Search](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/matching-engine/indexes) \n- A list of your active indexes is displayed.\n- Select the name of the index you want to deploy. The index details page opens.\n- From the index details page, click **add_box\n  Deploy to endpoint** . The index deployment panel opens.\n- Enter a display name - this name acts as an ID and can't be updated.\n- From the **Endpoint** drop-down, select the endpoint you want to deploy this index to.  Note: The endpoint is unavailable if the index is already deployed to it.\n- Optional: In the **Machine type** field, select either standard or high-memory.\n- Optional. Select **Enable autoscaling** to automatically resize the  number of nodes based on the demands of your workloads. The default number  of replicas is 2 if autoscaling is disabled.\n- Click **Deploy** to deploy your index to the endpoint. Note: It takes around 30 minutes to be deployed.\n## Enable autoscaling\nVector Search supports autoscaling, which can automatically resize the number of nodes based on the demands of your workloads. When demand is high, nodes are added to the node pool, which won't exceed the maximum size you designate. When demand is low, the node pool scales back down to a minimum size that you designate. You can check the actual nodes in use and the changes by [monitoring the current replicas](/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/monitor) .\nTo enable autoscaling, specify the `maxReplicaCount` and `minReplicaCount` when you deploy your index:\nThe following example uses the [gcloud ai index-endpoints deploy-index](/sdk/gcloud/reference/ai/index-endpoints/deploy-index) command.\nBefore using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:- : The ID of the index endpoint.\n- : A user specified string to uniquely identify the deployed index.

For your `DeployedIndex` to be covered by the SLA, you must set `minReplicaCount` to 2 or greater.\n## Mutate a DeployedIndex\nYou can use `MutateDeployedIndex` API to update the deployment resources (for example, `minReplicaCount` and `maxReplicaCount` ) of an already deployed index.\n- Users are not allowed to change the`machineType`after the index is deployed.\n- If`maxReplicaCount`is not specified in the request, the`DeployedIndex`will keep using the existing`maxReplicaCount`.\nThe following example uses the [gcloud ai index-endpoints mutate-deployed-index command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/ai/index-endpoints/mutate-deployed-index) .\nBefore using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:- : The ID of the index endpoint.\n- : A user specified string to uniquely identify the deployed index.
