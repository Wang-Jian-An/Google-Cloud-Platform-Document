This page also describes how to stop, start, reset, or delete an instance.", "content": "## Before you begin\n## Create an instance\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Instances** page. [Go to Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/instances) \n- Click add_box **Create new** .\n- For **Name** , enter `my-instance` .\n- Click **Create** .\nWhen you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see [Clean up](#clean-up) .## Open JupyterLabAfter you create your instance, Vertex AI Workbench automatically starts the instance. When the instance is ready to use, Vertex AI Workbench activates an **Open JupyterLab** link.\nNext to your instance's name, click **Open JupyterLab** .\nYour Vertex AI Workbench instance opens JupyterLab.## Open a new notebook file\n- In JupyterLab, select **File\u00a0> New\u00a0> Notebook** .\n- In the **Select kernel** dialog, select **Python 3** , and then click **Select** .Your new notebook file opens.\n## Stop your instance\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Instances** page. [Go to Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/instances) \n- Select the instance that you want to stop.\n- Click square **Stop** .\n## Start your instance\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Instances** page. [Go to Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/instances) \n- Select the instance that you want to start.\n- Click arrow_right **Start** .\n## Reset your instanceResetting an instance forcibly wipes the memory contents of your virtual machine (VM) and resets the VM to its initial state. To learn more, see [Reseta VM](/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance#resetting_an_instance) .- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Instances** page. [Go to Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/instances) \n- Select the instance that you want to reset.\n- Click **Reset** .\n## Clean upTo avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for   the resources used on this page, follow these steps.\nIf you created a new project to learn about Vertex AI Workbench instances and you no longer need the project, [delete the project](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) .\nIf you used an existing Google Cloud project, delete the resources you created to avoid incurring charges to your account:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Instances** page. [Go to Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/instances) \n- Select the row containing the instance that you want to delete.\n- Click delete **Delete** . (Depending on the size of your window, the **Delete** button might be in the more_vert options menu.)\n- To confirm, click **Confirm** .\n## What's next\n- Try one of the tutorials that are included in your new instance. In the JupyterLab folder **File Browser** , open the **tutorials** folder, and open one of the notebook files. \n- Read the [Introduction toVertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/introduction) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
