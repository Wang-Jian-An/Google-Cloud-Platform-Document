On January 30, 2025, support for  managed notebooks will end and the ability to create managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nThis page describes how to grant access to the JupyterLab interface of a Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instance.\nYou control access to a managed notebooks instance's JupyterLab interface through the instance's access mode. You set a JupyterLab access mode when you create a managed notebooks instance. The access mode can't be changed after the notebook is created.\nThe JupyterLab access mode determines who can use the instance's JupyterLab interface. The access mode also determines which credentials are used when your instance interacts with other Google Cloud services.\n", "content": "## Access limitations\nGranting a principal access to a managed notebooks instance's JupyterLab interface doesn't grant access to the instance itself. For example, to start, stop, or reset an instance, you must grant the principal access to perform those operations by setting an [IAM policy](/iam/docs/policies) on the instance. To grant access to the managed notebooks instance, see [Manage access toa managed notebooks instance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/manage-access) .\n## JupyterLab access modes\nManaged notebooks instances support the following access modes:\n- [Single user only](#single-user-only) : The **Single user only** access mode grants access only to the user that you specify.\n- [Service account](#service-account) : The **Service account** access mode grants access to a service account. You can grant access to one or more users through this service account.\n**Note:** To grant access to the instance through the single user option  or the service account, you must use an individual's  user account email address. Group access is not supported.\n## Single user only\nWhen you create a managed notebooks instance with **Single user only** access, you specify a user account. The specified user account is the only user with access to the JupyterLab interface. If the instance needs to access other Google Cloud resources, this user account must also have access to those Google Cloud resources.\n**Note:** When you create a managed notebooks instance with **Single user only** access, your instance completes the boot process using the Compute Engine default service account. Your specified user account can access the instance after the boot process is finished.\n### Grant access to a single user\nTo grant access to a single user, complete the following steps.\n- [Createa managed notebooks instance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/create-instance#advanced-settings) with the following specifications:- In the **Create instance** dialog, in the **IAM and security** section, select the **Single user only** access mode.\n- In the **User email** field, enter the user account that you want to grant access.\n- Complete the rest of the dialog, and then click **Create** .## Service account\nWhen you create a managed notebooks instance with **Service account** access, you specify a service account. If the instance needs to access other Google resources, this service account must have access to those Google resources also.\nWhen you specify a service account, choose one of the following:\n- Select the Compute Engine default service account.\n- Specify a custom service account. The custom service account must be in the same project as your managed notebooks instance. To create the instance, you must have the`iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`permission on the service account.\nTo grant access to users through a service account, you grant the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission on the specified service account for each user who needs to access JupyterLab.\n### Grant access to multiple users through a service account\n- [Createa managed notebooks instance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/create-instance#advanced-settings) with the following specifications:- In the **Create instance** dialog, in the **IAM and security** section, select the **Service account** access mode.\n- Choose the Compute Engine default service account or a [customservice account](/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) .- To use the Compute Engine default service account, select **Use Compute Engine default service account** .\n- To use a custom service account, clear **Use Compute Engine default service account** , and then, in the **Service account email** field, enter your custom service account email address.\n- Complete the rest of the dialog, and then click **Create** .\n- For each user who needs to access JupyterLab, [grant the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on yourservice account](/iam/docs/manage-access-service-accounts) .## Access mode metadata\nThe access mode that you configure during managed notebooks instance creation is stored in the notebook metadata.\nWhen you select the **Single user only** access mode, Vertex AI Workbench stores a value for `proxy-mode` and `proxy-user-mail` . The following are examples of single user access metadata entries:\n- `proxy-mode=mail`\n- `proxy-user-mail=user@example.com`\nWhen you select the **Service account** access mode, Vertex AI Workbench stores a `proxy-mode=service_account` metadata entry.\n**Caution:** Changing the access mode metadata is not supported and can make the JupyterLab interface inaccessible.\n## What's next\n- [Grant a principal access toa managed notebooks instance.](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/manage-access) \n- To learn how to grant access to other Google resources, see [Manage access toother resources](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
