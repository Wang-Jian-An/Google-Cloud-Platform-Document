To manage access to Vertex AI resources, see the [Vertex AI page on access control](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control) .\nYou grant access to a Vertex AI Workbench instance by setting an [Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy](/iam/docs/policies) on the instance. The policy binds one or more principals, such as a user or a service account, to one or more [roles](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/iam#iam-roles) . Each role contains a list of permissions that let the principal interact with the instance.\nYou can grant access to an instance, instead of to a parent resource such as a project, folder, or organization, to exercise the principle of [least privilege](/iam/docs/using-iam-securely#least_privilege) .\nIf you grant access to a [parent resource](/iam/docs/resource-hierarchy-access-control) (for example, to a project), you implicitly grant access to all its child resources (for example, to all instances in that project). To limit access to resources, set IAM policies on lower-level resources when possible, instead of at the project level or above.\nFor general information about how to grant, change, and revoke access to resources unrelated to Vertex AI Workbench, for example, to grant access to a Google Cloud project, see the IAM documentation for [managing access to projects, folders, andorganizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\n#", "content": "## Access limitations\nAccess to an instance can include a broad range of abilities, depending on the role you assign to the principal. For example, you might grant a principal the ability to start, stop, upgrade, and monitor the health status of an instance. For the complete list of IAM permissions available, see [PredefinedVertex AI Workbench IAMroles](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/iam#iam_roles) .\nHowever, even granting a principal full access to a Vertex AI Workbench instance doesn't grant the ability to use the instance's JupyterLab interface. To grant access to the JupyterLab interface, see [Manage access to an instance'sJupyterLab interface](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/manage-access-jupyterlab) .\n## Grant access to Vertex AI Workbench instances\nTo grant users permission to access a specific Vertex AI Workbench instance, set an [IAM policy](/iam/docs/policies) on the instance.\nTo grant a role to a principal on a Vertex AI Workbench instance, use the [get-iam-policy](/sdk/gcloud/reference/workbench/instances/get-iam-policy) command to retrieve the current policy, edit the current policy's access, and then use the [set-iam-policy](/sdk/gcloud/reference/workbench/instances/set-iam-policy) command to update the policy on the instance.\n### Retrieve the current policy\nBefore using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:- : The name of your instance\n- : Your Google Cloud project ID\n- : The zone where your instance is located\nExecute the  following  command:\nThe response is the text of your instance's IAM policy. See the following for an example.\n```\n{\n \"bindings\": [ {\n  \"role\": \"roles/notebooks.viewer\",\n  \"members\": [  \"user:email@example.com\"\n  ]\n }\n ],\n \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\",\n \"version\": 3\n}\n```\n### Edit the policy\n- Edit the policy with a text editor to add or remove principals and their associated roles. For example, to grant the `notebooks.admin` role to `eve@example.com` , add the following new binding to the policy in the `\"bindings\"` section:```\n{\u00a0 \"role\": \"roles/notebooks.admin\",\u00a0 \"members\": [\u00a0 \u00a0 \"user:eve@example.com\"\u00a0 ]}\n```After adding the new binding, the policy might look like the following:```\n{\u00a0 \"bindings\": [\u00a0 \u00a0 {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"role\": \"roles/notebooks.viewer\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"members\": [\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"user:email@example.com\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ]\u00a0 \u00a0 },\u00a0 \u00a0 {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"role\": \"roles/notebooks.admin\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"members\": [\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"user:eve@example.com\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ]\u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 ],\u00a0 \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\",\u00a0 \"version\": 3}\n```\n- Save the updated policy in a file named `request.json` .\n### Update the policy on the instanceIn the body of the request, provide the updated IAM policy from the previous step, nested inside a `\"policy\"` section.\nBefore using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:- : The name of your instance\n- : Your Google Cloud project ID\n- : The zone where your instance is located\nSave the following content in a file called `request.json` :\n```\n{\u00a0 \"policy\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \"bindings\": [\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"role\": \"roles/notebooks.viewer\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"members\": [\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"user:email@example.com\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 },\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"role\": \"roles/notebooks.admin\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"members\": [\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"user:eve@example.com\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 ],\u00a0 \u00a0 \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \"version\": 3\u00a0 }}\n```\nExecute the  following  command:\n### Grant access to the JupyterLab interfaceGranting a principal access to a Vertex AI Workbench instance doesn't grant the ability to use the instance's JupyterLab interface.
