On January 30, 2025, support for  user-managed notebooks will end and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nThis page describes how you can create a user-managed notebooks instance based on a specific [Deep Learning VM Images](/deep-learning-vm/docs) version.\n", "content": "## Why you might want to create a specific version\nTo ensure that your user-managed notebooks instance has software that is compatible with your code or application, you might want to create a specific version.\nUser-managed notebooks instances are created by using Deep Learning VM images. Deep Learning VM images are updated frequently, and specific versions of preinstalled software and packages vary from version to version.\nTo learn more about specific Deep Learning VM versions, see the [Deep Learning VMrelease notes](/deep-learning-vm/docs/release-notes) .\nAfter you create a specific version of a user-managed notebooks instance, you can upgrade it. Upgrading the instance updates the preinstalled software and packages. For more information, see [Upgrade a user-managednotebooks instance's environment](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/upgrade) .\n## Before you begin\n- If you plan to use GPUs with your user-managed notebooks instance, [check the quotas page in the Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/quotas) to ensure that you have enough GPUs available in your project. If GPUs are not listed on the quotas page, or you require additional GPU quota, you can request a quota increase. See [Requesting an increase in quota](/compute/quotas#requesting_additional_quota) on the Compute Engine [Resource quotas](/compute/quotas) page.### Required roles\nIf you created the project, you have the Owner ( `roles/owner` ) IAM role on the project, which includes all required permissions. Skip this section and start creating your user-managed notebooks instance. If you didn't create the project yourself, continue in this section.\nTo ensure that your user account has the necessary  permissions to create a Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks instance,   ask your administrator to grant your user account the  following IAM roles on the project:\n- Notebooks Admin ( [roles/notebooks.admin](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/iam#notebooks.admin) )\n- Service Account User ( [roles/iam.serviceAccountUser](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#iam.serviceAccountUser) )\nFor more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nYour administrator might also be able to give your user account  the required permissions through [custom  roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined  roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\n## Find the specific version that you want\nTo create a user-managed notebooks instance based on a specific Deep Learning VM version, you must know the image name of the specific Deep Learning VM version that you want to use.\nEach release of Deep Learning VM includes updates to many different images, and each image in the release has its own image name.\nTo find the specific image name that you want:\n- Find the Deep Learning VM release number that you want to get image names for. Release numbers are included in the [Deep Learning VMrelease notes](/deep-learning-vm/docs/release-notes) . Release numbers are in the form of an `M` followed by the number of the release, for example, `M79` .\n- To list the image names for a specific Deep Learning VM release, run the following command.```\ngcloud compute images list --project=\"deeplearning-platform-release\" \\\n --format=\"value(name)\" \\\n --filter=\"labels.release=RELEASE_NUMBER\" \\\n --show-deprecated\n```Replace `` with a Deep Learning VM release number, such as `M79` .\n- Find the image name that you want to use.## Create a specific version from the command line\nTo create a specific version of a user-managed notebooks instance from the command line, complete the following steps:\n- Run the following [gcloudnotebooks](/sdk/gcloud/reference/notebooks/instances/create) command:```\ngcloud notebooks instances create INSTANCE_NAME \\\n --vm-image-project=\"deeplearning-platform-release\" \\\n --vm-image-name=VM_IMAGE_NAME \\\n --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE \\\n --location=LOCATION\n```Replace the following:- ``: the name of your new instance\n- ``: the image name that you want to use to create your instance\n- ``: the [machinetype](/compute/docs/machine-types) of your instance's VM\n- ``: the Google Cloud [location](/vertex-ai/docs/general/locations#user-managed-notebooks-locations) where you want your new instance to be\n- Access your instance from the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed) .## What's next\n- Learn more about [upgradinguser-managed notebooks instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/upgrade) to ensure that your instance upgrades only when you are ready.\n- [Install dependencies](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/dependencies) on your new user-managed notebooks instance.\n- Learn more about Deep Learning VM instances in the [Deep Learning VMdocumentation](/deep-learning-vm/docs) .\n- Learn about [monitoring the health status](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/monitor-health) of your user-managed notebooks instance.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
