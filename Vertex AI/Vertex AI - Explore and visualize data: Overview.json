On January 30, 2025, support for  managed notebooks will end and the ability to create managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nThis page identifies common ways to explore and visualize data in Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks. You can use pre-installed Python packages and R libraries that are commonly used for data visualization. To explore and visualize BigQuery data, you can use the BigQuery client library with packages that visualize data.\n#", "content": "## Common Python packages and R libraries\nBy default, managed notebooks instances are pre-installed with common Python packages and R libraries for data visualization, for example [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) , [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) , and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) . Import or load these packages and libraries into your notebook file and they are ready to use.\n### BigQuery data\nYou can use common Python packages to visualize BigQuery data. The BigQuery client library provides additional methods, and by default the BigQuery client library is pre-installed in managed notebooks instances. For an example of how to use the BigQuery client library with Python plotting capabilities, see [Explore and visualize data inBigQuery tables](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/visualize-data-bigquery) .\nTo see an example of exploring and visualizing BigQuery data as part of a comprehensive workflow in managed notebooks,  run the \"Interactive exploratory analysis of BigQuery data in a notebook\" Jupyter notebook in one of the following  environments: [Openin Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/deploy-managed-notebook?download_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FGoogleCloudPlatform%2Fvertex-ai-samples%2Fmain%2Fnotebooks%2Fofficial%2Fworkbench%2Fexploratory_data_analysis%2Fexplore_data_in_bigquery_with_workbench.ipynb) | [Openin Colab Enterprise](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/import/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FGoogleCloudPlatform%2Fvertex-ai-samples%2Fmain%2Fnotebooks%2Fofficial%2Fworkbench%2Fexploratory_data_analysis%2Fexplore_data_in_bigquery_with_workbench.ipynb) | [View on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/workbench/exploratory_data_analysis/explore_data_in_bigquery_with_workbench.ipynb)\n## What's next\n- [Explore and visualize data inBigQuery tables.](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/visualize-data-bigquery) \n- To learn more about BigQuery, see [What is BigQuery?](/bigquery/docs/introduction)", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
