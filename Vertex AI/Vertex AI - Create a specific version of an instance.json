Deep Learning VM images are updated frequently, and specific versions of preinstalled software and packages vary from version to version.\nTo learn more about specific Deep Learning VM versions, see the [Deep Learning VMrelease notes](/deep-learning-vm/docs/release-notes) .\nAfter you create a specific version of a Vertex AI Workbench instance, you can upgrade it. Upgrading the instance updates the preinstalled software and packages.\n## Before you begin\n## Find the specific version that you want\nTo create a Vertex AI Workbench instance based on a specific Deep Learning VM version, you must know the image name of the specific Deep Learning VM version that you want to use.\nEach release of Deep Learning VM includes updates to many different images, and each image in the release has its own image name.\nTo find the specific image name that you want:\n- Find the Deep Learning VM release number that you want to get image names for. Release numbers are included in the [Deep Learning VMrelease notes](/deep-learning-vm/docs/release-notes) . Release numbers are in the form of an `M` followed by the number of the release, for example, `M108` .\n- To list the image names for a specific Deep Learning VM release, run the following command.```\ngcloud compute images list --project=\"cloud-notebooks-managed\" \\\n --format=\"value(name)\" \\\n --filter=\"labels.release=RELEASE_NUMBER\" \\\n --show-deprecated\n```Replace `` with a Deep Learning VM release number, such as `M108` .\n- Find the image name that you want to use.## Create a specific version\nYou can create a specific version of a Vertex AI Workbench instance by using the Google Cloud console.\n- When you [create an instance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/create) , in the **Environment** section, select **Use a previous version** .\n- In the **Verson** drop-down list, select a version.\n- Access your instance from the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/instances) .## What's next\n- Learn more about [upgradingVertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/upgrade) to ensure that your instance upgrades only when you are ready.\n- Learn more about Deep Learning VM instances in the [Deep Learning VMdocumentation](/deep-learning-vm/docs) .\n- Learn about [monitoring the health status](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/monitor-health) of your Vertex AI Workbench instance.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
