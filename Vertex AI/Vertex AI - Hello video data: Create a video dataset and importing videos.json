After your Dataset is created, use the CSV pointing to the videos you copied into your Cloud Storage bucket to import those videos into the Dataset.\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Setting up your project.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl) \n- Creating a video classification dataset.\n- [Training an AutoML video classification model.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/training) \n- [Deploying the model for batch predictions.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/deploy-predict) \n- [Cleaning up your project.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/cleanup) \nEach page assumes that you've already performed the instructions from the previous pages of the tutorial.\n", "content": "## Create a video classification dataset and import data\nVisit the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/) to begin the process of creating your dataset and training your model.\nWhen prompted, make sure to choose the project you selected during setup.\n- From the Get started with Vertex AI page, click **Create dataset** . \n- The **Create dataset** window appears- Provide a name for your Dataset.\n- Select the **Video** data type.\n- Select the **Video classification** objective.\n- Leave default region tag, **us-central1** , as is.\n- Click **Create** .\n \n- The data import window appears.- Select theradio_button_checked **Select\nan import file from Cloud Storage** .\n- For this quickstart, use the CSV file is at:`[gs://]automl-video-demo-data/hmdb_split1_5classes_all.csv``automl-video-demo-data`is the name of the Cloud Storage publicly accessible read-only bucket.\n- **Data split** should remain as the default: \"Automatic\".\n- Click **Continue** to begin video import. **Import in progress** appears. \nThe import process takes a few minutes. When it completes, you will receive an email from Vertex AI. Click the link in the email to go to the **Browse** tab for your dataset. This dataset has the annotation set (\"demo-data_vcn\" in this tutorial) that contains the newly imported data.\n## What's next\nTo start an AutoML model training job, follow the [next page of this tutorial](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/training) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
