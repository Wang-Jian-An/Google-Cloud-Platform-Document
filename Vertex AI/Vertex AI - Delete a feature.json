Deleting a feature unregisters the feature column from the Feature Registry and doesn't affect the data in the column in the registered BigQuery source table or view. You can [create another feature](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-feature) in any feature group to register the same column again, if necessary.\nUse the following sample to delete a feature from a feature group.\nTo delete a [Feature](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups.features#resource:-feature) resource, send a `DELETE` request by using the [features.delete](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups.features/delete) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the feature group is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the feature group containing the feature.\n- : The name of the feature that you want to delete.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nDELETE https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME/features/FEATURE_NAME\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X DELETE \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME/features/FEATURE_NAME\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.
