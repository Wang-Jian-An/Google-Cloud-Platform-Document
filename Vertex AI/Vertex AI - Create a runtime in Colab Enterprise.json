Runtimes are created based on a runtime template, which includes specifications like machine type and disk size.\nLearn more about [runtimes and runtime templates](/colab/docs/runtimes) .\n", "content": "## Before you begin\n### Required roles\nTo ensure that your user account has the necessary  permissions to create a runtime in Colab Enterprise,   ask your administrator to grant your user account the   Colab Enterprise Admin ( [roles/aiplatform.colabEnterpriseAdmin](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.colabEnterpriseAdmin) ) IAM role on the project.    For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nYour administrator might also be able to give your user account  the required permissions through [custom  roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined  roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\nUsers assigned the Code Creator role in a project can list the names of code assets in that project by using the Dataform API or the Dataform command-line interface (CLI). In preview, non-administrators using BigQuery Studio can only see code assets that they created or that were shared with them.\n## Create the runtime\nTo create a runtime:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to  the Colab Enterprise **Runtimes** page. [Go to Runtimes](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/runtimes) \n- In the **Region** menu, select the region where you want  your runtime. It must be in the same region as the notebook that  uses it.\n- Click add_box **Create  runtime** .The **Create Vertex AI runtime** dialog appears.\n- In the **Runtime template** menu,  select a runtime template. If there aren't any runtime templates listed, [create a runtime template](/colab/docs/create-runtime-template) .\n- In the **Runtime name** field, enter a name for your runtime.\n- Click **Create** .## Troubleshoot\nThis section shows you how to resolve issues with creating runtimes in Colab Enterprise.\n### Colab Enterprise unable to create a runtime\nThis issue occurs when you're unable to create a runtime. The most common causes are:\nIf you are unable to create a runtime, you might have exceeded your Compute Engine runtime quota.\nColab Enterprise uses Compute Engine quota for runtimes. For more information, see the [Compute Engine quota and limits overview](/compute/quotas-limits) .\nTo resolve this issue, [request a higher quota limit](/docs/quotas/view-manage#requesting_higher_quota) .The following error occurs when you try to create a runtime.\n```\nNo available zone found for runtime RUNTIME_ID\nfor machine type MACHINE_TYPE\nwith accelerator type: ACCELERATOR. Please try again later.\n```\nThis error occurs if there are no resources available for your machine type configuration within your notebook's region.\nTo resolve this issue, try a runtime with a different machine type configuration, or try again at a later time.\n## What's next\n- Learn more about [runtimes and runtime templates](/colab/docs/runtimes) .\n- [Connect to your runtime](/colab/docs/connect-to-runtime) .\n- Learn how to [create a runtime template](/colab/docs/create-runtime-template) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
