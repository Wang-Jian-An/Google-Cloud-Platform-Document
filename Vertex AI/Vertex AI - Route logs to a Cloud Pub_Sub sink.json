You can also sync pipeline logs into your observability tools. For more information about routing logs to a Cloud Pub/Sub sink, see [View logs routed to Pub/Sub](/logging/docs/export/pubsub) .\nThis section describes how you can create a Pub/Sub topic, route (or sink) pipeline job logs to the Pub/Sub topic, and verify the logs published to the Pub/Sub topic. You can then subscribe downstream applications to the Pub/Sub topic to power event-driven architectures, or sync pipeline logs with your observability tools in near real-time.\nUse the following instructions to set up a Pub/Sub sink and view the logs routed to it on the Google Cloud console:\n- Create a Pub/Sub topic. For more information, see [Create a topic in the Cloud Pub/Sub documentation](/pubsub/docs/create-topic#create_a_topic) .\n- On the **Subscriptions** page of the Google Cloud console, create a pull subscription for the Pub/Sub topic. For more information, see [Create pull subscription](/pubsub/docs/create-subscription#create_a_pull_subscription) .\n- Select **Logging** from the navigation menu, then click **Go to Log Router** : [Go to Log Router](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/router) \n- In your project containing the logs you want to route, click **Create Sink** .\n- Enter a name and description for the sink, and then click **Next** .\n- In the **Service** list, select **Cloud Pub/Sub topic** .\n- In the **Destination** list, select the Pub/Sub topic that you created, and then click **Next** .\n- Under **Choose logs to include in sink** , specify the following inclusion filter:```\nresource.type=\"aiplatform.googleapis.com/PipelineJob\"\n```\n- Click **Create Sink** .\n- On the **Subscriptions** page, click the subscription ID. [Go to Subscriptions page](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription/list) \n- Click the subcription ID that you created.\n- On the subscription details page, click the **Messages** tab.\n- To pull and view the pipeline job logs, click **Pull** ", "content": ".", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
