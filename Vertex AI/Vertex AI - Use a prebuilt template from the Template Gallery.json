To understand the terms of service of each template, refer to its associated documentation. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\n", "content": "## Create a pipeline run from the Template Gallery\nUse the following instructions to create a pipeline run from a Google-authored template from the **Template Gallery** . Alternatively, you can create your own custom pipeline template and then create a pipeline run based on it. For more information about creating and using a custom pipeline template, see [Create, upload, and use a pipeline template](/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/create-pipeline-template) .\n**Note:** These instructions describe how to create a pipeline run using the default interface of the **Create pipeline run** page, which includes the **Run details** and the **Runtime configuration** sections. For some templates from the **Template gallery** , this page has additional sections. For example, the **AutoML for Tabular Classification / Regression** template also includes the **Training Method** , **Training options** , and **Compute and pricing** sections.\nUse the following instructions to create a pipeline run from the **Template Gallery** :- In the Google Cloud console, in the **Vertex AI** section, go to the **Template Gallery** tab on the **Pipelines** page. [Go to Template Gallery](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pipelines) \n- Optional: To filter the list of pipeline templates, in the left pane, select the filter criteria. For example, to show only pipeline templates, select **Templates** under **Type** .\n- On the card corresponding to the template that you want to use, click **Create run** to open the **Create pipeline run** page.\n- In the **Run details** section, do the following:- Optional: Modify the default **Run name** that uniquely identifies the pipeline run.\n- Optional: To schedule recurring pipeline runs, specify the **Run schedule** , as follows:- Select **Recurring** .\n- Under **Start time** , specify when the schedule becomes active.- To schedule the first run to occur immediately after schedule creation, select **Immediately** .\n- To schedule the first run to occur at a specific time and date, select **On** .\n- In the **Frequency** field, specify the frequency to schedule and execute the pipeline runs, using a cron schedule expression based on [unix-cron](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html) .\n- Under **Ends** , specify when the schedule ends.- To indicate that the schedule creates pipeline runs indefinitely, select **Never** .\n- To indicate that the schedule ends on a specific date and time, select **On** , and specify the end date and time for the schedule.\n- Optional: To specify that the pipeline run uses a custom service account, a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK), or a peered VPC network, click **Advanced options** , and then follow these instructions:- To specify a service account, select a service account from the **Service account** drop-down list.If you don't specify a service account, Vertex AI Pipelines runs your pipeline using the default Compute Engine service account.Learn more about [configuring a service account for use withVertex AI Pipelines](/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/configure-project#service-account) .\n- To use a CMEK, select **Use a customer-managed encryption key** . The **Select a customer-managed key** drop-down list appears. In the **Select a customer-managed key** drop-down list, select the key that you want to use.\n- To use a peered VPC network in this pipeline run, enter the VPC network name in the **Peered VPC network** box.\n- Click **Continue** .\n- In the **Runtime configuration** section, configure the pipeline run, as follows:- Under **Cloud storage location** , click **Browse** to select the Cloud Storage bucket for storing the pipeline output artifacts, and then click **Select** .\n- Optional: To configure the failure policy and the cache for the pipeline run, click **Advanced options** , and then use the following instructions:- Under **Failure policy** , specify the failure policy for the entire pipeline. [Learn more about pipeline failure policies.](/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/configure-failure-policy) - To configure the pipeline to continue scheduling tasks after one task fails, select **Run all steps to completion** . This option is selected, by default.\n- To configure the pipeline to fail after one task fails, select **Fail this run as soon as one step fails** .\n- Under **Caching configuration** , specify the cache configuration for the entire pipeline.- To use the task-level cache configuration for task in the pipeline, select **Do not override task-level cache configuration** .\n- To turn on caching for all the tasks in the pipeline and override any task-level cache configuration, select **Enable read from cache for all steps (fastest)** .\n- To turn off caching for all the tasks in the pipeline and override any task-level cache configuration, select **Disable read from cache for all steps (fastest)** .\n- Optional: If your pipeline has parameters, under **Pipeline parameters** , specify your pipeline run parameters.\n- To create your pipeline run, click **Submit** .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
