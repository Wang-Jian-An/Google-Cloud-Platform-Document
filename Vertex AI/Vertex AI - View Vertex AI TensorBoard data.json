This web application offers several tools and dashboards to visualize and compare data across experiment runs, and to [profile model training performance](/vertex-ai/docs/training/tensorboard-profiler) .\nTo learn more about each dashboard, see the [README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/README.md#the-visualizations) for \"The Visualization\".\n", "content": "## Access a Vertex AI TensorBoard web app\nThe Vertex AI TensorBoard web app is accessed using the following address format:\n`https://` `` `.tensorboard.googleusercontent.com/experiment/projects+` `` `+locations+` `` `+tensorboards+` `` `+experiments+` ``\n- ``: the region your TensorBoard is located in\n- ``: the project your TensorBoard was created in\n- ``: the [TensorBoard ID](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/tensorboard-setup#tensorboard_id) \n- ``: the name of the TensorBoard experiment\nThis link can be shared and used by anyone who has permission.\nYou can navigate here directly by inserting the appropriate values, or by following a link available in the following ways.\n### gcloud CLI and Vertex AI SDK for Python\nWhen creating or uploading logs to a Vertex AI TensorBoard, the gcloud CLI and SDK output a link to the Vertex AI TensorBoard instance.\n### Google Cloud console\nYou can access the TensorBoard web app using the Google Cloud console.\nIf your Vertex AI TensorBoard is associated with a Vertex AI   Experiment, which is automatic when a [default instance](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/tensorboard-setup#use_default_instance) is involved, you can access the TensorBoard web app directly from the Experiments page. If you used Vertex AI TensorBoard with [custom training](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/tensorboard-training) you can access the TensorBoard web app directly from the custom training job.- In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to   the **Training** page. [Go to Training](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/training) \n- Click **Custom Jobs** tab.\n- Select your training job from the list of training runs. The details page appears\n- Click the **Open TensorBoard** button.\nIf you used Vertex AI TensorBoard with [Vertex AI Pipelines](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/tensorboard-with-pipelines) , the TensorBoard web app can be accessed  directly from the component information display.- In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to the **Pipelines** page. [Go to Pipelines](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pipelines) \n- From the pipelines tab, scroll or filter the pipeline list to find your  pipeline.\n- On the pipeline display select the component where TensorBoard metrics are  captured, typically the training component.\n- Select the **Open TensorBoard** button in the upper right.## Visualize Vertex AI TensorBoard metrics in the Google Cloud console\nIf your TensorBoard instance is associated with a Vertex AI Experiments, which is automatic when using a [default TensorBoard instance](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/tensorboard-setup#use_default_instance) , certain metrics can be visualized directly in the Google Cloud console, without using the web application.\nThe [Compare and analyze runs](/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/compare-analyze-runs#console-compare-analyze-runs) document describes how to view details of your experiment runs and compare the experiment runs to each other in the Google Cloud console. TensorBoard timeseries metrics appear under the **Charts** tab in the navigation bar of the Vertex AI Experiments console.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
