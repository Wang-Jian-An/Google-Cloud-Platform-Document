Each feature corresponds to feature values contained in a specific column in the BigQuery source table or view associated with the feature group.\nUse the following samples to retrieve the list of features in a feature group.\nUse the following instructions to view the list of features within a feature group using the Google Cloud console.- In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to the **Feature Store** page. [Go to the Feature Store page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/feature-store) \n- In the **Feature groups** section, click the expand icon next to the feature group name to view all the features within it.\nTo retrieve a list of all the [Feature](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups.features#resource:-feature) resources within a specific feature group in your project, send a `GET` request by using the [features.list](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups.features/list) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the featuregroup is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the feature group for which you want to view the  list of features.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME/features\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X GET \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME/features\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nExecute the following command:\n```\n$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token$headers = @{ \"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $cred\" }Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME/features\" | Select-Object -Expand Content\n```\nYou should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"features\": [ {\n  \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME/features/FEATURE_NAME_1\",\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-09-06T23:16:00.429055Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-09-06T23:16:00.429055Z\",\n  \"etag\": \"AMEw9yP4QWrXwty9C5J9a77O3_yV5LW4DUIIagKpmoHdzctF577OtlBlOyZC7EIQUZ8_\",\n  \"versionColumnName\": \"double\"\n },\n {\n  \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups/FEATURE_GROUP_NAME/features/FEATURE_NAME_2\",\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-09-07T00:59:39.330881Z\",\n  \"updateTime\": \"2023-09-07T00:59:39.330881Z\",\n  \"etag\": \"AMEw9yOZhegkDL44AMibnanMoDNJeVx-MHwcOqAQuihGHWFQxJMpvG3ePH3bNDS-tIRX\",\n  \"versionColumnName\": \"double2\"\n }\n ]\n}\n```\n", "content": "## What's next\n- Learn how to [create a feature view](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featureview) .\n- Learn how to [update a feature](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-feature) .\n- Learn how to [delete a feature](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/delete-feature) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
