If you have a well-performing model you'd like to use in another location, training a new model is not the best option. Model training is non-deterministic in nature therefore it's unlikely you'd end up with an identical model from identical data. Additionally, training a model in each region is not a foolproof way to maintain cross-region model behavior consistency. This is where the copy model feature comes in. With the Vertex AI Model Registry copy model functionality, you can easily copy a model from the Vertex AI Model Registry into a separate region in the same project.\n**Note:** Currently the copy model feature does not support copying Natural Language and BigQuery ML models.\nWhen performing a model copy, if you don't specify the model version you want to copy over, the default model version is copied. To learn more about model default or the model alias, see [How to use model aliases](/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/model-alias) .\n", "content": "## Limitations\nWhen you copy a model, not all model information is copied over. The copied model won't retain the following:\n- Version aliases.\n- The custom model ID- you can specify a new ID once the model is copied.\n- Any existing model evaluation.\n- Encryption specs - you are required to specify a new one upon copy for your target region.\n- Deployments and batch predictions.## Copy AutoML and custom models between locations from the console\nYou can copy models as a new model within the target region, or as a new version of an existing model in that region.\nUse the following instructions to copy models between locations.- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Models** page. [Go to Models](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/models) \n- From the Model Registry, select the **More actions** menumore_vert.\n- Click **Copy to another region** \n- From the Copy Model panel, select the version of the model you want to  copy and select the region you want to copy to.## Copy AutoML and custom models between locations programmatically\nUse the following code sample to copy a model using the copy method of the model resource. Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:\n- : The region where you are using Vertex AI.\n- : The Vertex AI region from which you   will copy the model.\n- : Your project ID or project number.\n- : ID of the model to copy.\n- : (Optional) ID of the model version to copy   (if not provided the default version is copied)HTTP method and URL:\n`POST https://LOCATION-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/models:copy`\nRequest JSON body:\n`\"sourceModel\": projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/SOURCE_LOCATION/models/MODEL_ID[@VERSION_ID]`\ncurl:\n```\ncurl -X POST \\-H \"Authorization: Bearer \"$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token) \\-H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\" \\-d @request.json \\\"https://LOCATION-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/models:copy\"\n```\nResponse\n```\n{\u00a0 \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/models/MODEL_COPY_ID/operations/OPERATION_ID\",\u00a0 \"metadata\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.CopyModelOperationMetadata\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \"genericMetadata\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"createTime\": \"2022-07-01T00:10:55.621355Z\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"updateTime\": \"2022-07-01T00:10:55.621355Z\"\u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 }}\n```", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
