If you don't have the permissions to perform these tasks, [ask an administrator](#ask_admin) to setup a project and enable Vertex AI for you. Also covered in this page is how to set up the Google Cloud CLI in your local development environment.\n", "content": "## Set up a project\nFollow these steps to set up a project:## Enable Vertex AI APIs\n- In the Google Cloud console, make sure your project name is displayed at the top of your [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) . If it's not, click [Select a project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard) to open the **Project Selector** , and select your intended project.\n- If you aren't in the Vertex AI portion of the Google Cloud console,  do the following:- In **Search** , enter Vertex AI, then return\n- In the search results, click Vertex AIThe Vertex AI dashboard appears.\n- Click **Enable All Recommended APIs** in the Vertex AI dashboard.It might take a few moments for the enabling process to complete. A blue ring circling the bell icon appears in the upper right of the Google Cloud console as the APIs are being enabled.\n### Install the Google Cloud CLI\n- To activate Google Cloud services and gain access to useful tools like [gsutil](/storage/docs/gsutil) , which enables transferring files to and from Cloud Storage, [install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.\n- To [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command from your command prompt:`gcloud init`\n- To update and install beta Google Cloud CLI components, run the following:`gcloud components update``gcloud components install beta`## Ask an administrator to set up a Vertex AI project for you\nThis section describes how an administrator grants the roles needed to use Vertex AI.\n- Determine a meaningful project name and project ID to identify your project. If you are part of an organization or plan to create multiple projects, consider what naming conventions and [folder](/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#folders) hierarchies are followed, or could be followed, to make project organization clear.\n- Required roles:- Access to most Vertex AI capabilities is granted by the [Vertex AI User](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.user) `(roles/aiplatform.user)`IAM role and should suffice   for most Vertex AI users. For full control of Vertex AI   resources, you can request the [Vertex AI Administrator](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.admin) `(roles/aiplatform.admin)`role. To explore the differences between   these and other Vertex AI roles, see [ Vertex AI access control with IAM](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control) .\n- If you also intend to use [Vertex AI Workbench notebooks](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/introduction) in Google Cloud, ask your administrator to grant you the [Notebooks Administrator](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#notebooks.admin) `(roles/notebooks.admin)`IAM role for the project,   as well as [the Service Account User](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#iam.serviceAccountUser) `(roles/iam.serviceAccountUser)`IAM role on either the   project or the [Compute Engine  default service account](/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default_service_account) .\n- Additionally, to enable the necessary APIs, you either need the [Service Usage Admin](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin) `(roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin)`IAM role   or your administrator needs to enable the APIs for you by following   the first few steps.\n- Ask your administrator to enable Vertex AI APIs for you. If you're granted the [Service Usage Admin](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin) `(roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin)`IAM role, then you'll be able to do this on your own by following the [Enable Vertex AI APIs](#enable_vertexai_apis) section.\n**Note:** Certain tasks in Vertex AI require that you use additional Google Cloud products besides Vertex AI. For example, in most cases, you must use Cloud Storage and Artifact Registry when you create a custom training pipeline. You might need to perform additional setup tasks to use other Google Cloud products.\n## What's next\n- Read an [overview ofVertex AI](/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) .\n- Walk through one of the [tutorials for usingVertex AI](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials) .\n- Learn how to [use the Vertex AI SDK for Python](/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/use-vertex-ai-python-sdk) , which provides another way to interact with Vertex AI.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
