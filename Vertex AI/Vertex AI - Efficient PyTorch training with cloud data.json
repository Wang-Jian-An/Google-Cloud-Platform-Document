Therefore, choose any training frameworks to build the trainer.\nFor PyTorch training with large amounts of data, the best practice is to use the distributed training paradigm and to read data from Cloud Storage. Check out the blog post [Efficient PyTorch training with Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/efficient-pytorch-training-with-vertex-ai) for methods to improve the training performance. You can see an overall 6x performance improvement with data on Cloud Storage using `WebDataset` and choosing `DistributedDataParallel` or `FullyShardedDataParallel` distributed training strategies. The training performance using data on Cloud Storage is similar to the training performance using data on a local disk.\nThe prebuilt [MNasNet classification example](https://github.com/google/vertex-ai-nas/blob/main/pytorch/classification/cloud_search_main.py) has incorporated these methods into its training pipeline", "content": ".", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
