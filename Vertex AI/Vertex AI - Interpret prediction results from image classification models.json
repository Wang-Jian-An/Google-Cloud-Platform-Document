The higher the number, the higher the model's confidence that the label should be applied to that item. You decide how high the confidence score must be for you to accept the model's results.In the Google Cloud console, Vertex AI provides a slider that's used to adjust the confidence threshold for all classes or labels, or an individual class or label. The slider is available on a model's detail page in the **Evaluate** tab. The confidence threshold is the confidence level that the model must have for it to assign a class or label to a test item. As you adjust the threshold, you can see how your model's precision and recall changes. Higher thresholds typically increase precision and lower recall.\nBatch AutoML image classification prediction output are stored as [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) files in Cloud Storage buckets. Each line of the JSON Lines file contains all annotation (label) categories and their corresponding confidence scores for a single image file.\n**Note** : The following JSON Lines example includes line breaks for readability. In your JSON Lines files, line breaks are included only after each each JSON object.\n```\n{\n \"instance\": {\"content\": \"gs://bucket/image.jpg\", \"mimeType\": \"image/jpeg\"},\n \"prediction\": {\n \"ids\": [1, 2],\n \"displayNames\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"],\n \"confidences\": [0.7, 0.5]\n }\n}\n``", "content": "`", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
