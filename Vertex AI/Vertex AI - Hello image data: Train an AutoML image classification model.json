After your dataset is created and data is imported, use the Google Cloud console to review the training images and begin model training.\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Set up your project and environment.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl) \n- [Create an image classification dataset, and import images.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/dataset) \n- Train an AutoML image classification model.\n- [Evaluate and analyze model performance.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/error-analysis) \n- [Deploy a model to an endpoint, and send a prediction.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/deploy-predict) \n- [Clean up your project.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/cleanup) \nEach page assumes that you have already performed the instructions from the previous pages of the tutorial.\n", "content": "## Review imported images\nAfter the dataset import, you are taken to the **Browse** tab. You can also access this tab by selecting **Datasets** from the menu. Select the **annotation set** (set of single-label image annotations) associated with your new dataset.\n**Key point:** Anis the collection of annotations associated with a data type and a specific objective (image data type, classification objective in this case). For more information about, see [Creating an annotation set](/vertex-ai/docs/datasets/create-annotation-set) .\n[Go to the Datasets page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/datasets)\n## Begin AutoML model training\nChoose one of the following options to begin training:\n- Choose **Train new model** .\n- Select **Models** from the menu, and select **Create** .\n- [Go to the Models page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/models) \n- Select **Create** to open the **Train new model** window.\n- Select **Select Training method** , and select the **target Dataset** if they are not automatically selected. Make sure the radio_button_checked **AutoML** radio button is selected, and then choose **CONTINUE** . \n- (Optional) Select **Define your model** , and enter the **Model name** . Click **CONTINUE** . \n- Select **Train options** . Select a model option according to your accuracy and latency needs. Optionally, enable incremental training and click **CONTINUE** .Incremental training considerations follow:- Incremental training can be enabled when there is at least one base model that has been trained in this project with the same objective.\n- Incremental training lets you use an existing base model as a starting point to train a new model rather than training a new model from scratch.\n- Incremental training generally helps training to occur faster and saves training time.\n- The base model can be trained from a different dataset.\n \n- Select **Compute and pricing** . Specify a node-hour budget of **8 node hours** . Select **Start training** . \nTraining takes several hours. An email notification is sent when the model training completes.\n## What's next\nFollow the [next page of this tutorial](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/error-analysis) to check the performance of your trained AutoML model and explore ways of making it better.\nFollow [Deploy a model to an endpoint and make a prediction](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-automl/deploy-predict) to deploy your trained AutoML model. An image is sent to the model for prediction.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
