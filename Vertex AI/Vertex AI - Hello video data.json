You'll set up your Google Cloud project to use Vertex AI. Then create a Cloud Storage bucket and copy image files to use for training an AutoML video classification model.\nTo complete this tutorial, you can either follow the instructions in the following pages or use the in-console walkthrough tutorial, which is a similar tutorial in the Google Cloud console.\n", "content": "## Tutorial pages\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Setting up your project](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl) .\n- [Creating a video classification dataset](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/dataset) .\n- [Training an AutoML video classification model](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/training) .\n- [Deploying the model for batch predictions](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/deploy-predict) .\n- [Cleaning up your project](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/video-classification-automl/cleanup) .\n### In-console walkthrough tutorial\nThese two tutorials are available in the Google Cloud console.\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a video classification model using Google's AutoML technology.\nTo follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the Google Cloud console, click **Guide me** :\n[Guide me](https://console.cloud.google.com/?walkthrough_id=vertex_video_classification_part1)\nThis is the second tutorial on building an AutoML video classification model.
