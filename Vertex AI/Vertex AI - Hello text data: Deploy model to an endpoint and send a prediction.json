After your model is deployed to the endpoint, send a document to the model for label prediction.\nThis tutorial has several pages:\n- [Setting up your project and environment.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl) \n- [Creating a text classification dataset .](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/dataset) \n- [Training an AutoML text classification model.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/training) \n- Deploy model to an endpoint and send a prediction.\n- [Cleaning up your project.](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/cleanup) \nEach page assumes that you have already performed the instructions from the previous pages of the tutorial.\n", "content": "## Deploy your model to an endpoint\nAccess your trained model to deploy it to a new endpoint from the **ModelRegistry** page.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Model Registry** page. [Go to the Model Registry page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/models) \n- For **Region** , select **us-central1 (Iowa)** .\n- Click the name and version number of your trained AutoML model to view details about your model.For example, in the **Evaluate** tab, you can view your model's performance metrics.\n- Select the **Deploy & test** tab to create an endpoint.\n- Click **Deploy to endpoint** .\n- In the **Deploy to endpoint** window, complete the following steps:- Choose radio_button_checked **Create newendpoint** and enter a name for the endpoint such as `hello_automl_text` .\n- Accept the **Traffic split** of **100%** , and click **Deploy** .It takes several minutes to create the endpoint and deploy the AutoML model to the new endpoint.\n## Send a prediction to your model\nAfter the endpoint is created, you can send text predictions from the Vertex AI console.\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Model Registry** page. [Go to the Model Registry page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/models) \n- For **Region** , select **us-central1 (Iowa)** .\n- Click your trained AutoML model.\n- Select the **Deploy & test** tab\n- In the **Test your model** section, enter text for prediction.\n- Click **Predict** to view the model's predicted label and confidence score.## What's next\n- To clean up resources that you have created, follow the [last page of the tutorial](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/text-classification-automl/cleanup)", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
