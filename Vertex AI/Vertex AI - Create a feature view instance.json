{"title": "Vertex AI - Create a feature view instance", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featureview", "abstract": "# Vertex AI - Create a feature view instance\nYou can create a feature view within an existing online store instance. While creating a feature view, you can associate features with it in the following ways:\n- **Add feature groups and features from Feature Registry:** Associate with existing feature groups and features from the Feature Registry. A feature group specifies the location of the BigQuery data source. A feature within the feature group points to a specific feature column within that data source. You can associate a feature view with multiple feature groups.\n- **Add features from a BigQuery source:** Directly associate a BigQuery data source, such as a BigQuery table or view, and specify the entity ID column.\nAfter you create a feature view, Vertex AI Feature Store syncs the latest feature values from the BigQuery data source. If you set the query parameter `run_sync_immediately=true` , then Vertex AI Feature Store syncs the feature values when you create the feature view. Otherwise, Vertex AI Feature Store syncs the feature values according to the [sync](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/sync-data) schedule specified for the feature view.\n", "content": "## Sync feature data in a feature view\nVertex AI Feature Store periodically refreshes, or syncs, the feature values stored in the online store from BigQuery. When you create a feature view, you can specify the schedule or frequency for the data sync using the [FeatureView.sync_config](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews#FeatureView.FIELDS.sync_config) parameter.\nYou also have the option to manually trigger a data sync for a feature view. For more information about how to manually sync data for a feature view, see [Sync feature data to online store](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/sync-data) .\nNote that only one data sync operation can be active at a time for a feature view. If a data sync is in progress for a feature view, all scheduled data syncs for that feature view are skipped until the sync is completed.\n### Optimize costs during sync\nA data sync operation might involve costs for BigQuery resource usage. Follow these guidelines to optimize these costs and improve performance during a data sync:\n- Don't configure the sync schedule to run more frequently than the frequency at which the data is expected to change in the BigQuery source.\n- Optimize the size of the feature data source in BigQuery. While creating the feature view, only include the data that you need for online serving.\n- Avoid running complex aggregations in BigQuery. Run a `SELECT *` query on the table or view to estimate the volume and duration of data processing.\n- While setting the scaling options for the online store, set `max_node_count` to a value that's high enough to cover high loads during a data sync.\n- Schedule the sync for different feature views at different times within the same online store.\n- If your BigQuery table contains extensive historical data, consider partitioning the table using timestamps and specify a time range for retrieving the feature data. This minimizes the retrieval of obsolete feature data during sync.\n- Bigtable utilization increases during data syncs. For feature views created within online stores for Bigtable online serving, schedule sync jobs during off-peak times for best performance.## Configure the service account for a feature view\n**    Preview     ** This feature is subject to the \"Pre-GA Offerings Terms\" in the General Service Terms section   of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) .     Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nEach feature view uses a service account to access the source data in BigQuery during sync. Vertex AI Feature Store assigns the [BigQuery Data Viewer](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataViewer) Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to this service account.\nBy default, a feature view uses the service account configured for your project. With this configuration, any user with permission to create a feature view in your project can access the feature data in BigQuery.\nAlternatively, you can configure the feature view to use its own service account. Vertex AI Feature Store then sets up a dedicated service account for the feature view. With this configuration, you can restrict access to feature data in BigQuery or grant access to additional users. You can specify the service account configuration by using the [FeatureView.service_agent_type](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews#FeatureView.FIELDS.service_agent_type) parameter.\n## Configure vector retrieval for a feature view\n**    Preview     ** This feature is subject to the \"Pre-GA Offerings Terms\" in the General Service Terms section   of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) .     Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nYou can configure vector retrieval for a feature view created based on a if the associated data source contains the `embedding` column and the [online store is configured to support embedding management](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-onlinestore#configure_embedding) . You can specify the vector retrieval configuration by using the [FeatureView.vector_search_config](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews#vectorsearchconfig) parameter.\nNote that you can configure vector retrieval and manage embeddings only if the feature view is created by specifying a BigQuery source URI and not from feature groups and features from Feature Registry.\nFor information about how to up the BigQuery data source to support embeddings by including the `embedding` column, see [Data source preparation guidelines](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/prepare-data-source#guidelines) .\n## Create a feature view from feature groups\nYou can create a feature view based on feature data registered using feature groups and features. To associate multiple BigQuery data sources with the same feature view, you can specify multiple feature groups.\nIf you create a feature view by specifying feature groups and features:\n- Your data source must have a `feature_timestamp` column and can contain historical data.\n- Vertex AI Feature Store serves only the latest feature values based on the feature timestamp.\n- You can't configure embedding management for the feature view.\n### Create a feature view with the default service account configuration\nUse the following sample to create a feature view by associating multiple feature groups without specifying a service account configuration.\nTo create a [FeatureView](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews#resource:-featureView) resource, send a `POST` request by using the [featureViews.create](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores.featureViews/create) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where you want to create the feature view, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the online store instance where you want to create the feature view.\n- : The name of the new feature view instance that you want to create.\n- and: The names of the  feature groups from which you want to add features to the feature view.\n- and: Feature IDs from the feature groupthat you want to add to the feature view.\n- and: Feature IDs from the feature groupthat you want to add to the feature view.\n- : Cron schedule expression representing the frequency for syncing data to the  feature view.
