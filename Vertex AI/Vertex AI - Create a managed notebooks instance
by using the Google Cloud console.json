On January 30, 2025, support for  managed notebooks will end and the ability to create managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/migrate-to-instances) .Learn how to create a Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instance and open JupyterLab by using the Google Cloud console. This page also describes how to stop, start, reset, or delete a managed notebooks instance.To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the Google Cloud console, click **Guide me** :\n [Guide me](https://console.cloud.google.com/?walkthrough_id=vertex-ai--workbench--managed--create-managed-notebooks-instance-console-quickstart) \n", "content": "## Before you begin\n## Create an instance\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Managed notebooks** page. [Go to Managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/managed) \n- Click add_box **Create new** .\n- In the **Create instance** window, in the **Name** field, enter `my-instance` .\n- Click **Create** .\nWhen you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see [Clean up](#clean-up) .## Open JupyterLabAfter you create your instance, Vertex AI Workbench automatically starts the instance. When the instance is ready to use, Vertex AI Workbench activates an **Open JupyterLab** link.- Next to your managed notebooks instance's name, click **Open JupyterLab** .\n- In the **Authenticate your managed notebook** dialog, click the button to get an authentication code.\n- Choose an account and click **Allow** . Copy the authentication code.\n- In the **Authenticate your managed notebook** dialog, paste the authentication code, and then click **Authenticate** .Your managed notebooks instance opens JupyterLab.\n## Open a new notebook file\n- Select **File\u00a0> New\u00a0> Notebook** .\n- In the **Select kernel** dialog, select **Python** , and then click **Select** .Your new notebook file opens.\n## Change the kernelYou can change the kernel of your JupyterLab notebook file from the menu or in the file.\n- In JupyterLab, on the **Kernel** menu, click **Change kernel** .\n- In the **Select kernel** dialog, select another kernel to use.\n- Click **Select** .\n- In your JupyterLab notebook file, click the kernel name. \n- In the **Select kernel** dialog, select another kernel to use.\n- Click **Select** .\n## Stop your instance\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Managed notebooks** page. [Go to Managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/managed) \n- Select the instance that you want to stop.\n- Click square **Stop** .\n## Start your instance\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Managed notebooks** page. [Go to Managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/managed) \n- Select the instance that you want to start.\n- Click arrow_right **Start** .\n## Reset your instanceResetting an instance forcibly wipes the memory contents of your virtual machine (VM) and resets the VM to its initial state. To learn more, see [Reseta VM](/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance#resetting_an_instance) .- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Managed notebooks** page. [Go to Managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/managed) \n- Select the instance that you want to reset.\n- Click **Reset** .\n## Clean upTo avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for   the resources used on this page, follow these steps.\nIf you created a new project to learn about Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks and you no longer need the project, [delete the project](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) .\nIf you used an existing Google Cloud project, delete the resources you created to avoid incurring charges to your account:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Managed notebooks** page. [Go to Managed notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/managed) \n- Select the row containing the instance that you want to delete.\n- Click delete **Delete** . (Depending on the size of your window, the **Delete** button might be in the more_vert options menu.)\n- To confirm, click **Delete** .\n## What's next\n- Try one of the tutorials that is included in your new managed notebooks instance. In the JupyterLab folder **File Browser** , open the **tutorials** folder, and open one of the notebook files. \n- Read the [Introduction to managed notebooks](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/introduction) .\n- To learn more about advanced settings for managed notebooks instances, see [Createa managed notebooks instance](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/create-instance) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
