These end-to-end tutorials help you get started using Vertex AI Workbench and give you ideas for how to implement a specific project.\n", "content": "## Open the notebooks\nThese tutorials highlight specific Vertex AI Workbench capabilities but you can also use them in other environments, such as [Colaboratory (Colab)](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) .\nTo open a notebook tutorial in a Vertex AI Workbench instance:\n- Click the **Vertex AI Workbench** link in  the [notebook list](#notebook-list) .  The link opens the Vertex AI Workbench console.\n- In the **Deploy to notebook** screen, type a name for your new  Vertex AI Workbench instance and click **Create** .\n- In the **Ready to open notebook** dialog that appears after the instance starts,  click **Open** .\n- On the **Confirm deployment to notebook server** page, select **Confirm** .\n- Before running the notebook, select **Kernel\u00a0> Restart Kernel\n and Clear all Outputs** .\nTo open a notebook tutorial in Colab, click the **Colab** link in the [notebook list](#notebook-list) . Colab creates a VM instance with all needed dependencies, launches the Colab environment, and loads the notebook.\n## List of notebooks\nBy default, the following table shows a list of Vertex AI Workbench notebook tutorials. To see a list of other Vertex AI Jupyter notebooks, click the drop-down menu and select a service.\nAdd a <devsite-select> custom element and give it a unique 'id'.", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
