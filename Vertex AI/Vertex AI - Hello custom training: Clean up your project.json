[Activate Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true) \n- In the Cloud Shell session, run the following command:```\ncd hello-custom-sample\n```", "content": "## Delete Vertex AI resources\nThis section describes how to delete all of the Vertex AI resources that you created for this tutorial.\n### Undeploy your model from your endpoint\nThis section describes how to undeploy your model from your endpoint. You can think about this action as a way of disconnecting your model from your endpoint.\nYou must follow this section before you can [delete yourendpoint](#delete-endpoint) or [delete your model](#delete-model) .\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Endpoints** page. [Go to Endpoints](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/endpoints) \n- Click `hello_custom` to go to the endpoint details page.\n- On the row for your model, `hello_custom` , click **Undeploy modeldelete** .\n- In the **Undeploy model from endpoint** dialog, click **Undeploy** .\n### Delete your endpoint\nBefore you follow this section, you must [undeploy your model from yourendpoint](#undeploy-model) . Afterward, do the following to delete your endpoint:\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Endpoints** page. [Go to Endpoints](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/endpoints) \n- Find your the row of your endpoint, `hello_custom` , again. On that row, click **View more more_vert** .

Then click **Delete model** .\n- In the **Delete model** dialog, click **Delete** .\n### Delete your custom training pipeline and job\nYour training pipeline and custom job are just records of the training that happened earlier. If you want to delete your custom job, do the following:\n- In the Google Cloud console, in the Vertex AI section, go to the **Training pipelines** page. [Go to Training pipelines](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/training/training-pipelines) \n- Find your the row of your training pipeline, `hello_custom` . On that row, click **View more more_vert** .

On that row, click **View more more_vert** . Then click **Delete custom job** .\n- In the **Delete training job** dialog, click **Delete** .## Clean up your Cloud Shell session\nCloud Shell incurs no charges, and it [automatically deletes your homedisk after a period of inactivity](/shell/docs/limitations) . However, if you plan to use Cloud Shell for other purposes in the near future, you might want to manually remove the files that you created for this tutorial.\nIn your Cloud Shell session, run the following commands:\n```\ncd ..rm -rf hello-custom-sample\n```\n## Delete your Cloud Storage bucket\nIn your Cloud Shell session, run the following command:\n```\ngsutil -m rm -rf gs://BUCKET_NAME\n```\nReplace with the name of the Cloud Storage bucket that you created when reading the [first page of thistutorial](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-classification-custom) .\n## Delete your Cloud Function\nIn your Cloud Shell session, run the following command:\n```\ngcloud functions delete classify_flower --region=us-central1 --quiet\n```\n## What's next\n- To learn about additional ways to train ML models on Vertex AI, try one of the other [Vertex AI tutorials](/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials) .\n- Read an [overview of how Vertex AIworks](/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
