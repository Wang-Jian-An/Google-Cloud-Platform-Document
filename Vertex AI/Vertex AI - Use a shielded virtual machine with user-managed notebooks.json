On January 30, 2025, support for  user-managed notebooks will end and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances  will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function  but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using  Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you [migrate your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/migrate-to-instances) .\nSo you can be confident that your instances have not been compromised by boot- or kernel-level malware or rootkits, Shielded VM offers verifiable integrity of Compute Engine VM instances. Shielded VM's verifiable integrity is achieved through the use of [Secure Boot](/compute/shielded-vm/docs/shielded-vm#secure-boot) , [virtual trusted platform module(vTPM)](/compute/shielded-vm/docs/shielded-vm#vtpm) -enabled [MeasuredBoot](/compute/shielded-vm/docs/shielded-vm#measured-boot) , and [integritymonitoring](/compute/shielded-vm/docs/shielded-vm#integrity-monitoring) .\nFor more information, see [Shielded VM](/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm) .\n", "content": "## Requirements and limitations\nTo use Shielded VM with user-managed notebooks, you must create a Deep Learning VM Images with a Debian 10 OS that is [versionM51](/deep-learning-vm/docs/release-notes#July_13_2020) or higher.\nWhile using Vertex AI Workbench, you can't use shielded VM user-managed notebooks instances that use GPU accelerators.\n## Create a user-managed notebooks instance using a shielded VM\nTo create a shielded VM that you can use with user-managed notebooks, complete the following steps:\n- [Select the image family](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/images) that you want your instance to be based on. Use the following [Google Cloud CLI](/sdk/gcloud) command to list the available image families that are compatible with user-managed notebooks and Shielded VM. You can run the command in [Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com?cloudshell=true) or any environment where the [Google Cloud CLI](/sdk/docs) is installed.```\ngcloud compute images list \\\n --project deeplearning-platform-release \\\n --no-standard-images | grep debian-10\n```\n- Use the following command to create the Compute Engine instance.```\ngcloud compute instances create nb-legacy2 \\\n --image-project=deeplearning-platform-release \\\n --image-family=MY_IMAGE_FAMILY \\\n --metadata=\"proxy-mode=service_account\" \\\n --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform \\\n --shielded-secure-boot \\\n --zone=MY_ZONE\n```Replace the following:- ``: the image family name that you want to use to create your VM\n- ``: the zone where you want your instance to be located\n- [Register your Compute Engine VM with theNotebooks API](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/registering-legacy-notebooks#register) .## What's next\n- Learn more about [user-managed notebooks imagefamilies](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/images) .\n- Learn more about [modifying Shielded VMoptions](/compute/shielded-vm/docs/modifying-shielded-vm) .", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
