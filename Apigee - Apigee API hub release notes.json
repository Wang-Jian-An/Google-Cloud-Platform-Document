Results in conformance report artifacts attached to an API spec revision are now displayed in the right pane of the API spec revision detail page. One of the following is displayed:- **No information to display.** No style guide conformance information has been generated for this spec.\n- **No issues found.** Style guide conformance scans found no issues with this spec.\n- **Warnings and Errors.** Any errors or warnings are explained.An indicator also marks the corresponding line in the spec.\n **See also:** - [How are lint results calculated?](https://github.com/apigee/registry-experimental/tree/main/samples#how-are-lint-results-calculated) \n- [View a specification](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-hub/view-spec#view-a-specification) \n- [Manage revisions](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-hub/revisions) \n## June 26, 2023On June 26, 2023 Apigee API hub released a new version of the software.\nAPI hub has been upgraded to use a later version of the Registry API open-sourced project. See [v0.6.13](https://github.com/apigee/registry/releases/tag/v0.6.13) on GitHub for changes and links to previous revisions that are also included in this update. Note that this update (like all previous updates), overwrites project-level artifacts that configure API hub displays including display settings, taxonomies, and lifecycles. In future releases, we will no longer overwrite project-level artifacts.## June 16, 2023On June 16, 2023 Apigee API hub released a new version of the software.\nAPI hub has been upgraded to use a later version of the Registry API open-sourced project. See [v0.6.12](https://github.com/apigee/registry/releases/tag/v0.6.12) on GitHub for changes and links to previous revisions that are also included in this update.Note that artifacts associated with API spec and deployment resources are now associated with the revisions of those resources. This allows artifacts that represent lint results and other revision-specific characteristics to be associated with those revisions. When artifacts are applied directly to the parent resource (spec or deployment), these artifacts are associated with the latest revisions of these resources. For more details, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/apigee/registry/issues/774) .Migration of pre-existing spec- and deployment-related artifacts is not guaranteed in this update. In most cases, these artifacts are generated automatically by the registry controller and will be automatically recreated. If you find that manually-added artifacts are missing after the update, those will need to be reapplied with the same mechanisms that were available previously.## March 13, 2023On March 13, 2023 Apigee API hub released a new version of the software.\nFieldSet artifacts that are attached to an API are now displayed in the API overview page.## March 08, 2023On March 8, 2023, the Apigee Registry API documents were updated to include the [Google APIs Explorer](https://developers.google.com/explorer-help) panel.\nThe [Google APIs Explorer](https://developers.google.com/explorer-help) has been added to the [Apigee Registry API documents](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apigeeregistry/rest/v1/projects.locations/get) .
