For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\n", "content": "## \n Reserve a static IP\nFollow the steps below to create a static IP address for the runtime load balancer. This address exposes the hybrid runtime to API proxy requests coming from outside the cluster.\n**Note: ** It's important to create a static IP address, because when pods are restored or when you upgrade, it's possible that the external IP will change, causing an interruption in API traffic. By creating a static IP, the address exposed outside the cluster address will never change unless you release it.\n- Open the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and log in with the account you created in [Step 1: Create a Google Cloud account](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.3/precog-gcpaccount) .\n- Select the project that you created in [Step 2: Create a Google Cloud project](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.3/precog-gcpproject) .\n- If you have not already done so, enable the **Cloud DNS API** . See [Enabling APIs](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis) .\n- Create a static IP address: **Note: ** The static IP address will be the IP address that is exposed outside the cluster,  so give it a name that makes sense to you for that purpose. For example:`apigee-loadbalancer`- If you are on GKE, follow the instructions in [  Reserving a static external IP address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address#reserve_new_static) to create a static IP address.\n- If you are on GKE on-prem (Anthos), follow the instructions in the [  Installing using static IP addresses](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke/docs/on-prem/how-to/install-static-ips) to create a static IP address.\n- If you are on GKE on AWS (Anthos), you don't need to create a static IP address.\n- Copy the external IP address you just reserved. For example:`34.56.78.90`. You will need it in a later step.## \n Get a registered domain\nIf you already have a registered domain, you can use it for the Apigee hybrid installation. If not, you can register a domain name through [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) or another domain registrar of your choice.\n## \n Configure your DNS\nCreate a new A type record in a zone in your DNS server as follows:\n- Specify a DNS zone subdomain name. For example, suppose your zone's parent domain is`acme.com`, the subdomain name might be`myapi`. In this example, the address would be:`myapi.acme.com`.\n- Set the A record address to the numeric IP address of your **static IP** , in dotted decimal format.  For example:`34.56.78.90`.\nIf you do not have an existing domain available to use, we provide a quickstart example that shows how to use Google Domains and Google Cloud DNS to create a domain and set up a DNS zone.
