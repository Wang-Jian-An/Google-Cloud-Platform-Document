For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\nYou must add the IP address of the [MART](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.1/what-is-hybrid#mart) endpoint to your Apigee organization. You set this value previously when set the value of the `mart.hostAlias` property in your overrides file. The management plane needs this address so that it can communicate with the runtime plane over MART.\nFollow these steps to add the MART IP to your organization:\n**NOTE:** Perform this step only after have successfully deployed hybrid into your cluster, as explained in [Deploy hybrid to your cluster](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.1/install-hybrid) .\n- Get the value you set previously in your overrides file for the`mart.hostAlias`property. For MART to function, the host alias must  be a fully qualified domain name.\n- Locate the service account key with the **Apigee Organization Admin** role  that you downloaded previously, as explained in [Add service accounts](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.1/precog-serviceaccounts) .  You need the path to this JSON key file to complete the following steps.\n- Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path where the  service account key is located:```\nexport GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=your_sa_credentials_file.json\n```\n- Call the following Apigee API to update your organization with the MART endpoint:```\ncurl -v -X PUT \\\n https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/your_org_name \\\n -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)\" \\\n -d '{\n \"name\" : \"your_org_name\",\n \"properties\" : {\n \"property\" : [ {\n  \"name\" : \"features.hybrid.enabled\",\n  \"value\" : \"true\"\n }, {\n  \"name\" : \"features.mart.server.endpoint\",\n  \"value\" : \"https://HOST_ALIAS_DNS\"\n } ]\n }\n}'\n```Here is an example. Be sure to add the prefix \"https://\" to the domain name.```\ncurl -v -X PUT \\\n https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/my_organization \\\n -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)\" \\\n -d '{\n \"name\" : \"my_organization\",\n \"properties\" : {\n \"property\" : [ {\n  \"name\" : \"features.hybrid.enabled\",\n  \"value\" : \"true\"\n }, {\n  \"name\" : \"features.mart.server.endpoint\",\n  \"value\" : \"https://foo-mart.example.com\"\n } ]\n }\n}'\n``", "content": "`", "guide": "Apigee"}
