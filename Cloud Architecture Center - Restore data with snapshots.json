After you enable **Make snapshot directory (.snapshot) visible** in your volume options, a directory called `.snapshot` appears in the mount point of the volumes.\nThe following example shows a sequence of file operations on a volume mounted to a Linux client. The volume contains two files and also one snapshot. In this example, the user deletes a file and uses the snapshot to restore the latest version of the file from the newest snapshot.\n```\n $ df -h .\n Filesystem      Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n 10.31.240.4:/example-volume-1 1.0T 4.5M 1.0T 1% /netapp\n $ ls\n chinook.db readme.txt\n $ rm chinook.db\n $ ls -la .\n total 12\n drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4096 May 31 15:02 .\n drwxr-xr-x 20 root root 4096 May 31 13:42 ..\n drwxrwxrwx 3 root root 4096 May 31 14:35 .snapshot\n -rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 14 May 31 14:24 readme.txt\n $ ls .snapshot\n hourly.2022-05-31_1435\n $ ls .snapshot/hourly.2022-05-31_1435\n chinook.db readme.txt\n $ cp .snapshot/hourly.2022-05-31_1435/chinook.db .\n $ ls\n chinook.db readme.txt\n```\n## Restore data using a Windows client\nWhen the **Make snapshot directory (~snapshot) visible** option is enabled in the volume options, you can access snapshots with the **Previous Versions** tab of the Windows Explorer property window. Snapshots appear in the **Previous Versions** tab with the timestamp of snapshot creation. For example, if you accidentally delete a file, you can restore it to its original location by dragging and dropping it from a snapshot folder.\nYou can also access snapshots using the hidden `~snapshot` file path, as shown in the following example:\n```\n Z:\\dir z:\\~snapshot\n  Volume in drive Z is restore-example-1\n  Volume Serial Number is 8080-F15D\n  Directory of z:\\~snapshot\n 05/31/2022 04:08 PM <DIR>  ..\n 05/31/2022 03:59 PM <DIR>  hourly.2022-05-31-1600\n 05/31/2022 04:02 PM <DIR>  hourly.2022-05-31_1605\n     0 File(s)   0 bytes\n     3 Dir(s)    0 bytes free\n```\n## What's next\n- [Revert a volume using a snapshot](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/revert-volume-snapshot) \n- [Restore a snapshot to a new volume](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/back-up) \n- [Security considerations](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/security-considerations) \n- [FAQs about NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud](/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/faqs-netapp)", "guide": "Cloud Architecture Center"}
