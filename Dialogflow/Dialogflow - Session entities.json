All session data, including session entities, is stored by Dialogflow for 30 minutes.\nFor example, if your agent has a `@fruit` entity type that includes \"pear\" and \"grape\", that entity type could be updated to include \"apple\" or \"orange\", depending on the information your agent collects from the end-user. The updated entity type would have the \"apple\" or \"orange\" entity entry for the rest of the session.\n", "content": "## Managing session entities with the API\nTo manage session entities with the API, use the methods for the `SessionEntity` type.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
