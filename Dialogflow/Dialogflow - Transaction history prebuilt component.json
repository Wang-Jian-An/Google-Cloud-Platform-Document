{"title": "Dialogflow - Transaction history prebuilt component", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/transaction-history", "abstract": "# Dialogflow - Transaction history prebuilt component\nThe transaction history [prebuilt component](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component) checks a customer's [authentication level](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/authentication#authentication-levels) , then collects transactions time period and other filters which are applied when retrieving the transaction history. This component supports filters for:\n- Transaction type\n- Merchant name\n- Transaction amount\nIf the customer has multiple accounts, the component confirms the specific account the customer would like to retrieve transaction history for. This component uses the [Authentication](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/authentication) prebuilt component to authenticate users and uses a customized version of [Date of birth collection](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/date-of-birth-collection) to collect start and end dates for the transaction history.\n", "content": "## Limitations\nIn addition to the [common prebuilt component limitations](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#limits) , this prebuilt component has the following limitations:\n- This component does not encrypt any data.## Sample dialogs\nThe following sample dialogs demonstrate common scenarios handled by this prebuilt component. The sample dialogs demonstrate behavior when the component is called via telephony, which triggers the Default Welcome Intent and the first agent response at the start of the conversation.\n### Multiple accounts\nEnd-user has multiple accounts; the agent confirms which account the user is requesting transaction history for. The agent collects the transactions start and end dates, any filters the user would like to apply to the transactions, and whether the user would like to encrypt the transaction history. The agent sends the transaction history to the user.\n| User input | Agent response                                                         |\n|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| nan   | Agent authenticates user using Authentication prebuilt component                                            |\n| nan   | Thank you, you have been successfully authenticated.                                               |\n| nan   | Please wait while we are fetching your account details.
