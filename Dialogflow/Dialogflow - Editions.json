Flows and pages are the building blocks of conversation design, and state handlers are used to control conversation paths. The CX agent type is summarized in Dialogflow CX basics.    |\n| ES agent | This is the standard agent type that is suitable for small to medium and simple to moderately complex agents. Intents are the building blocks of conversation design, and contexts are used to control conversation paths. The ES agent type is summarized in Dialogflow ES basics. |\nThe following table provides a summary comparison of agent types.
