After confirming their locked card, the component allows the user to enroll for an upgrade or reissue a new card. This component uses a customized version of the [Authentication](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/authentication) prebuilt component to authenticate cardholders.\n", "content": "## Limitations\nIn addition to the [common prebuilt component limitations](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#limits) , this prebuilt component has the following limitations:\n- This component does not encrypt any data.## Sample dialogs\nThe following sample dialogs demonstrate common scenarios handled by this prebuilt component. The sample dialogs demonstrate behavior when the component is called via telephony, which triggers the Default Welcome Intent and the first agent response at the start of the conversation.\n### Unauthenticated user with single card\nThe agent identifies that the user has not been previously authenticated and collects information to verify that the user is a registered cardholder. Once the user has authenticated, the agent retrieves information about the single card registered to the user. The user confirms they would like to lock the card, the agent locks the card. Finally, the agent confirms the user's preferred card and delivery address and reissues a new card to the user.\n| User input  | Agent response                                                                                              |\n|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| nan   | Agent authenticates user using Authentication prebuilt component                                                                                 |\n| nan   | Thank you, you have been successfully authenticated.                                                                                    |\n| nan   | Please wait while we are fetching your card details.
