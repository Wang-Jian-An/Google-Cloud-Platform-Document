{"title": "Dialogflow - Contexts", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/contexts-overview", "abstract": "# Dialogflow - Contexts\nDialogflow are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you \"they are orange\", you need context in order to understand what \"they\" is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent.\nUsing contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting [input and output contexts](/dialogflow/docs/contexts-input-output) , which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with that correspond to the currently active contexts.\nThe following diagram shows an example that uses context for a banking agent.- The end-user asks for information about their checking account.\n- Dialogflow matches this end-user expression to the`CheckingInfo`intent.  This intent has a`checking`output context, so that context becomes active.\n- The agent asks the end-user  for the type of information they want about their checking account.\n- The end-user responds with \"my balance\".\n- Dialogflow matches this end-user expression to the`CheckingBalance`intent.  This intent has a`checking`input context,  which needs to be active to match this intent.  A similar`SavingsBalance`intent may also exist for matching the same end-user expression  when a`savings`context is active.\n- After your system performs the necessary database queries,  the agent responds with the checking account balance", "content": ".", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
