This component uses a customized version of the [Authentication](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/authentication) prebuilt component to authenticate account holders and cardholders. The component also uses a customized version of the [Date of birth](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/date-of-birth-collection) prebuilt component to collect dates for disputed transactions.\n", "content": "## Limitations\nIn addition to the [common prebuilt component limitations](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#limits) , this prebuilt component has the following limitations:\n- This component does not encrypt any data.## Sample dialogs\nThe following sample dialogs demonstrate common scenarios handled by this prebuilt component. The sample dialogs demonstrate behavior when the component is called via telephony, which triggers the Default Welcome Intent and the first agent response at the start of the conversation.\n### Unauthenticated user with transaction dispute\nThe agent identifies that the user has not been previously authenticated and collects information to verify that the user is a registered account holder. The agent collects information about the dispute including the account number, dispute mode, date, and amount, and creates a new case for the dispute.\n| User input    | Agent response                                                        |\n|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| nan      | Agent authenticates user using Authentication prebuilt component                                            |\n| nan      | Thank you, you have been successfully authenticated.                                               |\n| nan      | Remember that you can file a claim or dispute a charge on your online banking portal.
