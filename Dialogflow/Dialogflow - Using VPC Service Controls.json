Use VPC Service Controls to create a that protects the resources and data that you specify. For example, when you use VPC Service Controls to protect Dialogflow, the following artifacts cannot leave your service perimeter:\n- Agent data\n- Detect intent requests and responses", "content": "## Limitations\nThe following limitations apply:\n- If your agent does not integrate with [Service Directory private network access](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/webhook#sd) , webhook calls are considered outside the service perimeter and are blocked when enabling VPC Service Controls. Limited endpoints are supported by **Service Directory** , refer to [Service Directory](/service-directory/docs/private-network-access-overview) for details.\n- Using Cloud Functions for Dialogflow webhooks is currently not supported when in VPC Service Controls perimeter or in Service Directory.## Service perimeter creation\nWhen you create a service perimeter, include Dialogflow ( `dialogflow.googleapis.com` ) as a protected service. You aren't required to include any additional services for Dialogflow to function. However, Dialogflow won't be able to reach resources outside the perimeter, such as files in a Cloud Storage bucket that is outside the perimeter.\nFor more information about creating a service perimeter, see [Creating a service perimeter](/vpc-service-controls/docs/create-service-perimeters) in the VPC Service Controls documentation.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
