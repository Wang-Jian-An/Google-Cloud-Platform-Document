Once the user has been authenticated, the component provides information about the user's most recent or past orders. The user may then choose to exchange multiple items in an order and select options including refund and shipping methods. This component uses the [Retail authentication](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/authentication-retail) prebuilt component to authenticate users. The component also uses [Generators](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/generative/generators) for post-call summarization and FAQs.\n", "content": "## Limitations\nIn addition to the [common prebuilt component limitations](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#limits) , this prebuilt component has the following limitations:\n- This component does not encrypt any data.## Sample dialogs\nThe following sample dialogs demonstrate common scenarios handled by this prebuilt component.
