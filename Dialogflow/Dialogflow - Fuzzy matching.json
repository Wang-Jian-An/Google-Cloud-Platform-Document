{"title": "Dialogflow - Fuzzy matching", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/entity-fuzzy", "abstract": "# Dialogflow - Fuzzy matching\nBy default, entity matching requires an exact match for one of the entity entries. This works well for single-word entity entry values and synonyms but may present a problem for multi-word values and synonyms. For example, consider a entity that should be matched for the following end-user expression parts:\n- \"ball\"\n- \"red ball\"\n- \"ball red\"\n- \"small ball\"\n- \"ball small\"\n- \"small red ball\"\n- \"small ball red\"\n- \"red small ball\"\n- \"red ball small\"\n- \"ball small red\"\n- \"ball red small\"\nFor a match to occur, you normally need to define an entity entry value and synonyms for each of these permutations. However, with fuzzy matching enabled, the ordering of the words in a value or synonym does not matter. The following will trigger a match for all of the examples above:\n- \"ball\"\n- \"red ball\"\n- \"small ball\"\n- \"small red ball\"", "content": "## Create a fuzzy matching entity\n- Open the [Dialogflow CX Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx/projects) .\n- Choose your GCP project.\n- Select your agent.\n- Select the **Manage** tab.\n- Click **Entity Types** .\n- Click **Create** .\n- Check **Fuzzy matching** .\n- Complete remaining fields.\n- Click **Save** .\nSet the `EntityType.enableFuzzyExtraction` field to true.\n## Limitations\nThe following limitations apply:\n- Fuzzy matching cannot be enabled for [regexp entities](/dialogflow/docs/entities-regexp) . These features are mutually exclusive.\n- Fuzzy matching should not be enabled for entities which are used to match strict values like IDs, national identification numbers, and so on.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
