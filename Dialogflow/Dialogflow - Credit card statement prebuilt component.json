{"title": "Dialogflow - Credit card statement prebuilt component", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/credit-card-statement", "abstract": "# Dialogflow - Credit card statement prebuilt component\nThe credit card statement [prebuilt component](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component) checks a customer's [authentication level](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/authentication#authentication-levels) , then sends the credit card statement for a specified period of time to an authenticated customer. If the customer has multiple credit cards, the component confirms the specific card the customer would like to retrieve a credit card statement for. This component uses a customized version of the [Authentication](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/authentication) prebuilt component to authenticate cardholders and uses a customized version of [Date of birth collection](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/date-of-birth-collection) to collect start and end dates for the statement period.\n", "content": "## Limitations\nIn addition to the [common prebuilt component limitations](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#limits) , this prebuilt component has the following limitations:\n- This component does not encrypt any data.## Sample dialogs\nThe following sample dialogs demonstrate common scenarios handled by this prebuilt component. The sample dialogs demonstrate behavior when the component is called via telephony, which triggers the Default Welcome Intent and the first agent response at the start of the conversation.\n### Single credit card\nEnd-user has a single credit card.
