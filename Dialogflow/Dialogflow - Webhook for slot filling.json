This process is called [slot filling](/dialogflow/docs/intents-actions-parameters#required) .\nBy default, Dialogflow does not send a fulfillment webhook request until it has collected all required data from the end-user.\nIf is enabled, Dialogflow sends a fulfillment webhook request for each conversational turn during slot filling.\nWhile in most cases, the parameter prompts are enough to collect all required parameters, a webhook for slot-filling allows you to define more specific agent logic during collection of the parameters. For example, your webhook could handle the customization of follow-up questions or setting parameter slots that cannot be retrieved from the end-user response, like from a database.\n", "content": "## Enable webhook for slot filling\nTo enable webhook for slot filling at design-time:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow ES Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com) .\n- Select an agent.\n- Select **Intents** in the left sidebar menu.\n- Select an intent.\n- Scroll down to the **Fulfillment** section.\n- Toggle **Enable webhook call for slot filling** on.\n- Click **Save** .## Handle webhook for slot filling calls at runtime\nThe webhook request message received by your webhook service has a `queryResult.parameters` field. This field contains the current set of parameters provided by the end-user. Values that have not been collected yet are set to empty strings.\nAn example of the webhook response message for setting parameters can be found in [Webhook Response examples](/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-webhook#session_entity) .", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
