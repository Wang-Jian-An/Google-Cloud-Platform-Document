For example, NLU settings are applied at the flow version level. This means that each flow version can have its own NLU settings. The following describes the levels:\n| Level                   | Data                               |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Project (applies to all agents, environments, and flow versions in the project) | Security settings (although each agent can select different settings defined for the project) Location settings    |\n| Agent (applies to all environments and flow versions in the agent)    | All agent settings, except flow-specific settings                    |\n| Environment                  | nan                               |\n| Flow version                 | A snapshot of all agent resources (intents, entities, webhooks, and so on), all flow resources (pages), and all flow settings ", "content": "|", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
