For example, logging settings are applied at the agent version level, so each agent version can have its own logging settings. The following describes the levels:\n| Level             | Data                             |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Agent (applies to all environments and agent versions) | Knowledge bases Agent edition                       |\n| Environment           | Fulfillment and text-to-speech settings established when creating the environment          |\n| Agent version           | All other settings (logging, ML, knowledge base selection, and so on), and all resources (intents, entities, and so on) ", "content": "|", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
