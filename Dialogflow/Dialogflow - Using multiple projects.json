Each service account is owned by a specific project, but service accounts might be [provided roles to access resources for other projects](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/access-control#gcp-console) The project associated with the service account you provide for an API call is referred to as the .\nWhen you make calls to the API, your request specifies the agent's project. This project is referred to as the .\nFor example, in the following REST curl request, the project associated with `AGENT_ID` is the resource project, and the project associated with the service account used to generate `TOKEN` is the consumer project:\n```\ncurl -X GET\n -H \"Authorization: Bearer TOKEN\"\n \"https://REGION_ID-dialogflow.googleapis.com/v3/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION_ID/agents/AGENT_ID\"\n```\nOne project can play the role of both consumer and resource project. Agent data, charges, and quotas are associated only with this project.\nWhen consumer and resource projects are two different projects, charges, quota constraints, agent information, and a requirement to enable the API are applicable to either or both projects. The following table shows the association for an API call with two projects:\n| Description              | Consumer project (service account project) | Resource project (agent project) | Notes              |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Project that charges are incurred for       | \u2714           | nan        | nan              |\n| Project that's bound to quotas         | \u2714           | nan        | nan              |\n| Project that contains all agent data       | nan           | \u2714         | nan              |\n| Projects for which you must enable the Dialogflow API   | \u2714           | \u2714         | The Dialogflow API must be enabled for both project types. |\n| Project that shows API usage on the Cloud console API dashboard | \u2714           | nan        | nan              |", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
