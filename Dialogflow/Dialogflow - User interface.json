Currently, if you need to reference flows, you must use the Dialogflow CX console.\nThis guide focuses on describing the Vertex AI Conversation console.\n", "content": "## Left navigation icons\nThe Vertex AI Conversation user interface has the following left navigation icons:\n| Icon | Name     | Description               |\n|-------:|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| nan | Playbooks   | Used to create and edit playbooks for your agent.      |\n| nan | Tools    | Tools are used to connect to APIs or data stores.      |\n| nan | Test cases   | List and run test cases created with the simulator.     |\n| nan | Conversation history | Provides the conversation history for all interactions with the agent. |\n| nan | Integrations   | Integrate with other conversation platforms.       |\n| nan | Prebuilt agents  | Example agents for popular domains.         |\n| nan | Change history  | Track the history of changes to the agent.        |\n| nan | Agent settings  | Change settings such as agent name, location, models, and logging.  |\n## Create a playbook agent\nTo create a playbook agent:\n- If you have not already, follow the Dialogflow CX [setup](/dialogflow/cx/docs/quick/setup) instructions.\n- Go to the Vertex AI Conversation console: [Vertex AI Conversation console](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/) \n- Select your project from the console drop-down.\n- If you have not already activated the API, read and agree to the Terms of Service, then click **Continue and activatethe API** .\n- Click **Create a New App** or **New App** .\n- Select **Generative playbook** .\n- Provide a name for your playbook agent.\n- The list of playbooks for the playbook agent is shown.

These selectors let you choose between:- Flow resources\n- Generative resources\n- Shared resources\nTo create a playbook:- Select the generative resources on the left navigation.\n- Click **Playbooks** .\n- Click **Create new** .\n- Provide data.## Test cases\nThe existing [test case](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/test-case) feature has been enhanced to support playbooks.\nA required **expected test case result** field has been added, which provides a list of actions in the form of [playbook examples](/dialogflow/vertex/docs/concept/examples) . The test case verifies that the actions were performed as expected.\nWhen viewing a playbook or playbook version, you can click the **Test cases** tab above the playbook data to see test case results and to execute a test case on demand.\nYou can also compare test case results for different versions of a playbook. Select a test case, then click **Compare** .\nTo see all test cases for the agent, click **Test cases** in the left navigation.\n## Conversation history\nThe existing [conversation history](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/conversation-history) feature has been enhanced to support playbooks.\nInformation has been added for tool execution, playbook invocation, and flow invocation from a playbook agent.\n## Playbook versions\nYou can save playbook versions, which are immutable snapshots of playbooks.\nTo save a playbook version:\n- Load the playbook in the console.\n- Click **Version history** .\n- Click **Create version** .\n- Provide a version name and click **Save** .\nTo view version history:\n- Load the playbook in the console.\n- Click **Version history** .\n- Click **View version history** .\n- The version history panel opens on the right side.
