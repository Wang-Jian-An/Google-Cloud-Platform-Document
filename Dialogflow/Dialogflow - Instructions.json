Playbooks are referenced using the form`${PLAYBOOK: playbook_name}`.\n- An instruction to use a specific [tool](/dialogflow/vertex/docs/concept/tools) . Tools are referenced using the form`${TOOL: tool_name}`.\n- An instruction to route the user to a Dialogflow CX flow. Flows are referenced using the form`${FLOW: flow_name}`.\nEach step description starts with `-` , and you can define subinstructions using indentation.\nFor example:\n```\n- greet the customer and ask them how you can help.\n - If the customer wants to book flights, route them to ${PLAYBOOK: flight_booking}.\n - If the customer wants to book hotels, route them to ${PLAYBOOK: hotel_booking}.\n - If the customer wants to know trending attractions, use the ${TOOL: attraction_tool} to show them the list.\n- help the customer to pay for their booking by routing them to ${FLOW: make_payment}.\n```\n**Note:** When editing instructions, you may see a warning indicating that a resource reference has no corresponding [examples](/dialogflow/vertex/docs/concept/examples) . You can still save and use the playbook with this warning present, but it's unlikely to work reliably until examples that use the resource are added", "content": ".", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
