The instructions below focus on using the console. To access intent data:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow ES Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com) .\n- Select an agent.\n- Select **Intents** in the left sidebar menu.\n- Select an intent.\nIf you are building an agent using the API instead of the console, see the [Intents reference](/dialogflow/docs/reference/common-types#intents) . The API field names are similar to the console field names.\n## Priority\nYou can set a priority for each intent, [which affects how it is matched](/dialogflow/docs/intents-matching#priority) .\nTo set an intent's priority:\n- Click the colored dot to the left of the intent name.\n- Select the priority from the drop-down menu.In most cases, using the **Normal** priority is the best option. If there is a potential matching conflict between two intents, it is best to improve the training phrases to address the conflict. If you cannot remove the conflict with training phrases, you can use priorities to provide preference to one of the intents.\nIf the priority is **Ignore** , the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests.\nWhen using the API, priorities are provided as integers. The larger the number, the greater the priority. If the priority is unset or equal to `0` , the value is converted to `500,000` . The following table shows the relationship between integer priorities and the console's named priorities:\n| Console priority name | Integer priority set by console | Integer priority (p) range that maps to named priority |\n|:------------------------|----------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ignore     |        -1 | p < 0             |\n| Low      |       250000 | 0 < p \u2264 250,000           |\n| Normal     |       500000 | p = 0 or 250,000 < p \u2264 500,000       |\n| High     |       750000 | 500,000 < p \u2264 750,000         |\n| Highest     |       1000000 | p > 750,000            |\n## Fulfillment\nTo enable [fulfillment](/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-overview) for an intent:\n- Scroll down to the **Fulfillment** section.\n- Toggle **Enable webhook call for this intent** to on.\n- Click **Save** .## Disable ML\nIntent matching typically involves both [grammar matching and ML matching](/dialogflow/docs/intents-matching#algo) . You can configure an intent to disable ML matching and rely on grammar matching alone.\nYou may need to do this to prevent or reduce over-triggering of intents where it's possible to provide a near-complete set of training phrases.\n**Note:** This setting does not enforce exact matching, because grammar matching has some flexibility.\nTo disable ML matching:\n- Click the optionbutton at the top of the intent page.\n- Select **Disable ML** .", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
