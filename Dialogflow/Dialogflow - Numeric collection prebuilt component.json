The minimum and maximum length accepted can be configured via input parameters.\nThe component captures chunks of digits from the user on each conversational turn and concatenates them to form the final sequence. The minimum and maximum length accepted per chunk can be configured via input parameters.\nThe sequence capture will continue until the end-user indicates they are done with the sequence with input that matches the [prebuilt_components_confirmation_done intent](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#common-intents) .\n", "content": "## Limitations\nIn addition to the [common prebuilt component limitations](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#limits) , this prebuilt component has the following limitations:\n- Non-numeric characters are not supported. See [alphanumeric collection](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component/alphanumeric-collection) for support of letters and numbers.## Recommended agent settings\n[Enable DTMF](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/parameter#dtmf) to allow users to input numeric values using the telephone keypad.\n## Additional functionalities\nThe following additional functionalities are provided by this prebuilt component:\n- [Repeat](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#repeat-functionality) \n- [Waiting room](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#waiting-room-functionality) \n- [Playback](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#playback-functionality) ## Sample dialogs\nThe following sample dialogs demonstrate common scenarios handled by this prebuilt component. The sample dialogs demonstrate behavior when the component is called via telephony, which triggers the Default Welcome Intent and the first agent response at the start of the conversation.\n### Single chunk\nEnd-user provides numeric sequence in the first attempt; agent successfully accepts it.\n| User input  | Agent response                                                  |\n|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| nan    | Please start by saying the first 1 to 30 digits of the numeric sequence.

The parameters will be used by one or more conditions within the flow to determine how the component should behave. Flow-scoped parameters must be set on the start page of the component as described below. Session-scoped parameters may be set either by a calling flow, or on the start page of this component.\nYou can configure the minimum and maximum lengths accepted per capture and for the final collected sequence by modifying [parameter presets](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/fulfillment#param-preset) in the [flow's start page](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/flow#data) .\nThis prebuilt component accepts the following input parameters:\n| Parameter Name   | Description            | Input Format |\n|:-------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:---------------|\n| $flow.numeric_min_length | Minimum length of the final numeric sequence    | integer  |\n| $flow.numeric_max_length | Maximum length of the final numeric sequence    | integer  |\n| $flow.lower_limit  | Minimum length of the chunk a user can provide each turn | integer  |\n| $flow.upper_limit  | Maximum length of the chunk a user can provide each turn | integer  |\n## Output parameters\nOutput parameters are session parameters that will remain active after exiting the component. These parameters contain important information collected by the component.
