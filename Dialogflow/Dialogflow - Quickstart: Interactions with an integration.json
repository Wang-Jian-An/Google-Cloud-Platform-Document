You just need to build an agent, optionally implement a webhook, and configure the integration.\nThis guide shows you how to use the [Dialogflow Messenger](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/dialogflow-messenger) integration to provide a simple text chat user interface for your agent.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\nIf you don't plan on using an integration, you can skip this quickstart.\nYou should do the following before reading this guide:\n- Read [Dialogflow CX basics](/dialogflow/cx/docs/basics) .\n- Perform [setup steps](/dialogflow/cx/docs/quick/setup) .\n- Perform steps in the [Build an agent](/dialogflow/cx/docs/quick/build-agent) quickstart guide. Steps below continue working on the same agent. If you no longer have that agent, you can [download the agent](/static/dialogflow/cx/docs/data/agent-shirts-1-flow.zip) and [restore it](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent#export) .## Setup\n**Note:** The steps below create an integration that allows unauthenticated agent query access. See the [Dialogflow Messenger documentation](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/dialogflow-messenger) for instructions to create an authenticated integration.\n**Note:** Make sure [billing is enabled](/dialogflow/cx/docs/quick/setup#billing) on your project before testing the integration.\nTo set up unauthenticated access to your Dialogflow Messenger agent:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow CX Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx/projects) .\n- Choose your Google Cloud project.\n- Select your agent.\n- Select the **Manage** tab.\n- Click **Integrations** in the left sidebar menu.\n- Click **Connect** on **Dialogflow Messenger** .\n- A configuration dialog opens.\n- If the integration was previously setup for this agent, you will see embeddable HTML code. Regardless of whether you want what authenticated or unauthenticated, click the **Disable...** button at the bottom of the dialog, so you can reconfigure the settings in the next step.\n- Select an **Environment** .\n- Select **Unauthenticated API** .\n- Select a style.\n- Optionally restrict domain access.\n- Click **Enable the unauthenticated API** .\n- The dialog will show the embeddable HTML code that can be embedded on your website. Copy this code.\n- Click **Done** .\n## Embed\nPaste the embed code you copied above in a webpage on your website. The `<script>` and `<df-messenger>` HTML elements should be in the `<body>` element of your page.\nIf you are using an authenticated integration, set the `oauth-client-id` attribute for `<df-messenger>` to your Oauth client id.\nUpdate any other attributes that require updating.\nTo allow for responsive layouts, also add the following to your `<head>` element:\n```\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n```\nOnce embedded, you can interact with your agent through the webpage by clicking the chat icon in the lower right corner.\n## Customize\nYou can customize the appearance and behavior of this user interface in many ways. See the [Dialogflow Messenger documentation](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/dialogflow-messenger) for more information.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
