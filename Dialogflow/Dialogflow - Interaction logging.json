You can browse and delete this data with the [History](/dialogflow/es/docs/history) and [Training](/dialogflow/es/docs/training) tools.\n", "content": "## Enable and disable interaction logging\n**Note:** If you disable interaction logging, the History and Training features will not be available.\nInteraction logging is enabled by default for new agents.\nTo enable or disable interaction logging for your agent, see the logging options in the [agent's general settings](/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-settings#general) .\n## Handling end-user data\nUser information may reside within your agent's logs stored by Dialogflow. Disabling conversation logs only prevents future data storage and does not delete existing data. Existing data is retained until the agent is deleted or you delete specific conversations from [History](/dialogflow/es/docs/history#delete) or [Training](/dialogflow/es/docs/training#training-view) .\nIf you choose to disable logging performed by Dialogflow, you can still create private logs within your system. If you are calling the Dialogflow API directly, log request and response data within your system. If you are using a Dialogflow integration, enable a webhook for every intent, and log request and response data within your webhook system.\n## Data retention\nInteraction logging data is retained in Google systems for 400 days before being deleted.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
