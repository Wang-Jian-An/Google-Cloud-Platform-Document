Requests sent to your agent are handled by Google services in this region and Dialogflow keeps [data-at-rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_at_rest) physically within the geographical [region or location](/about/locations) . For the best performance, you should choose a region that is near your services and end-users.\nOnce an agent is created, its location cannot change. In order to change an agent's location, you must [export and restore](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent#export) to a new agent with a different location.\nEach location has associated settings that apply across your project. In most cases, you do not need to edit these location settings, and the default settings will work well. If your system requires [customer-managed encryption keys](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/cmek) (often required by government entities or regulated industries), read more about [location settings](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#location-settings) .\n", "content": "## Limitations\nThe following limitations apply:\n- Region support for different telephony integrations may vary. Check documentation for each integration.\n- System entity support differs for each [language](/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/language) . See the [system entity limitations](/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/system-entities#limits) for details.\n- The [APIs Explorer](https://developers.google.com/explorer-help/) , found on many [REST reference documents](/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest) , only supports the `global` region for API calls.## Available regions\nDialogflow CX supports the following regions for agent location. [Data store agents](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/data-store-agent) support a subset of these regions and the region IDs used by data stores differ slightly from the agent regions. All regions with a value for the Data store region ID column are supported by data store agents in [Vertex AI Conversation](/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/agent-intro) .\n| Country grouping | Geographical location    | Agent region ID            | Data store region ID |\n|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|\n| Americas   | Iowa        | us-central1             | us multi-region  |\n| Americas   | Montr\u00e9al       | northamerica-northeast1          | nan     |\n| Americas   | South Carolina      | us-east1             | nan     |\n| Americas   | Oregon        | us-west1             | nan     |\n| Europe    | Belgium       | europe-west1            | eu multi-region  |\n| Europe    | London        | europe-west2            | nan     |\n| Europe    | Frankfurt       | europe-west3            | nan     |\n| Asia Pacific  | Sydney        | australia-southeast1          | nan     |\n| Asia Pacific  | Tokyo        | asia-northeast1            | nan     |\n| Asia Pacific  | Mumbai        | asia-south1             | nan     |\n| Asia Pacific  | Singapore       | asia-southeast1            | nan     |\n| Global    | Global serving, data-at-rest in US | global (preferred), us (deprecated), or no region (default) | global     |\n**Note:** Calls to the `global` region may have higher latency when called from outside of the US.

Once settings for a specific location are configured for a project, the settings cannot change for that location. If you need to change these settings, you must create a new project.\nIf you create an agent without editing the location settings, the default settings will be configured for that location, and they cannot be changed for the project. In addition, once an agent is created, its location cannot change. In order to change an agent's location, you must [export and restore](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent#export) to a new agent with a different location.\nThe following location settings are available:\n- **Encryption** : This setting controls whether Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys are used to protect data. The default is Google-managed. You must request access (by contacting your Google representative) to the [customer-managed encryption keys](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/cmek) feature to change this setting.\nYou can configure location settings in two ways:\n- Click **Location settings** from the [agent selector interface](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/console#agent) .\n- Click the **Edit** button next to the **Location** drop down when [creating an agent](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent#create) .\n**Note:** Currently, you cannot update location settings with the API.\n## Specify a region with the API\nYou must specify a region for all API requests.\nFor REST calls, you must do both of the following:\n- Provide the region ID for the `location` URL path parameter.\n- Use `[region-id]-dialogflow.googleapis.com` for the hostname.\nFor example:\n- `us-central1-dialogflow.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/us-central1/agents/{AGENT_ID}`\nFor client libraries, see the [client library documentation](/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/library/overview) for a region configuration option.\nYou can find examples in the [API quickstart](/dialogflow/cx/docs/quick/api) .\n**Caution:** As described in the [setup documentation](/dialogflow/cx/docs/quick/setup#auth-env) , you should use the`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`environment variable to provide your client libraries with credentials. However, if you need to manually provide a credentials file in your code, you need to take one additional step when calling a regionalized endpoint. Set the scope to`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`when generating your authentication credentials. For example, this is accomplished in Java when creating a`GoogleCredentials`object:```\nGoogleCredentials.fromStream(new FileInputStream(\"credential_file\"))\n .createScoped(\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\")\n \n```\n## Cloud logging\nSee the [Cloud logging guide](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/logging) to control the region in which logs are stored.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
