[Waiting room functionality](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#waiting-room-functionality) is implemented in several prebuilt components and can be added additionally to non-prebuilt agents and components.\n", "content": "## Limitations\nIn addition to the [common prebuilt component limitations](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#limits) , this prebuilt component has the following limitations:\n- Waiting room does not extend the session's timeout, see [Sessions](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/session) for default behavior.\n- By default, the waiting room component will exit after three no-matches or three no-input [built-in events](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/handler#event-built-in) , timing out according to the no-speech timeout configured in [Advanced speech settings](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent#settings-speech) . To increase this limit, configure the no-match and no-input event handlers in the`Main`page.\n- Waiting room will exit after the session times out or after it has exhausted the event handlers on the`Main`page, whichever occurs first.## Sample dialogs\nThe following sample dialogs demonstrate common scenarios handled by this prebuilt component.\n### Successful hold\nEnd-user asks the agent to hold. Once the user says \"I'm ready\", the agent returns to the conversation.\n| User input   | Agent response                                         |\n|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| nan    | Please say or enter the first part of your credit card number.

For more detail, see [Flow-level routes](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/handler#route-flow) .\n- Click **Save** .\n- On pages where you want to enable the waiting room, add two new routes.- The first route allows the conversation to return to the page where the end-user originally asked the agent to hold:- [Condition](/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/condition) :`$session.params.from_waiting_room_reusable_flow = true`\n- [Parameter presets](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/fulfillment#param-preset) :- Parameter:`from_waiting_room_reusable_flow`\n- Value:`false`\n- [Transition page](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/handler#symbolic) : Current page\n- The second route determines what happens after an end-user has exceeded their retry limit for no-match or no-input in the waiting room flow:- [Condition](/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/condition) :`$session.params.waiting_room_event_handler = true`\n- [Parameter presets](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/fulfillment#param-preset) :- Parameter:`waiting_room_event_handler`\n- Value:`null`\n- [Transition page](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/handler#symbolic) : should be set according to what should happen after the end-user has used all their retry attempts for the waiting room flow, for example routing to another page, ending the flow, or ending the session.\n### Complete\nYour agent should now be set up and ready to test.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
