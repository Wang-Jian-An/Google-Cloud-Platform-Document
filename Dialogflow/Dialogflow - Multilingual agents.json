{"title": "Dialogflow - Multilingual agents", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-multilingual", "abstract": "# Dialogflow - Multilingual agents\nDialogflow supports many languages. For the complete list, see the [languages reference page](/dialogflow/es/docs/reference/language) . The language you choose when creating an agent is set as the default language, and you can add additional languages.\n", "content": "## Root and locale-specific languages\nThere are two categories of languages:\n- **Root languages** : These are languages likethat do not specify a locale.\n- **Locale-specific languages** : These are languages likethat do specify a locale as a specific region or country.\nSome languages act as both root and locale-specific. There are significant differences between locales for these languages, so the locales cannot share a common root language. Examples:\n- Chinese-Cantonese (zh-HK)\n- Chinese-Simplified (zh-CN)\n- Chinese-Traditional (zh-TW)\n- Portuguese-Brazil (pt-BR)\n- Portuguese-Portugal (pt)\nYou should primarily design your agent for root languages, and only customize for locale-specific languages as needed.\n## Add a language\n**Key Point:** As a best practice, you should complete your agent in the default language before adding additional languages.\nTo add a language or locale with the Dialogflow Console:\n- In the left sidebar menu, click the add languagebutton next to the existing language(s).This takes you to the **Languages** tab of agent settings.\n- Choose a language from the **Select Additional Language** dropdown menu.\n- To add a locale, hover over a root language and click **+ Add locale** .\n- Click **Save** .## Language-specific data\n**Note:** The information in this section applies to both locale-specific and root languages. For example; en, en-US, and en-GB each have unique data for intent training phrases.\nMost agent data is common for all languages of a multilingual agent. However, text used to interact with an end-user is language-specific. When building a multilingual agent, you must supply this language-specific data for each language. When you select a language from the console or provide a language to the API, you can access this language-specific data for the given language. The following is a complete list of language-specific data:\n- [intent training phrases](/dialogflow/es/docs/intents-training-phrases) \n- [intent responses](/dialogflow/es/docs/intents-responses) \n- [entity entries](/dialogflow/es/docs/entities-overview) \nTo access language-specific data with the console, click the language button under the agent name.\nFor example, the entity type below is used for ordering t-shirts. The agent was originally configured in English, so the entity has entries like \"S\" with the synonym \"small\". When Spanish is added as a language, the entity is created by Dialogflow for the new language, but you need to supply entity entries in Spanish.\nTo access language-specific data with the API, provide the `languageCode` parameter when getting, creating, or updating [EntityType](/dialogflow/es/docs/reference/common-types#entitytypes) or [Intent](/dialogflow/es/docs/reference/common-types#intents) types.\nYou must make separate API calls for each language to access all language-specific data. If your API calls update language-generic data, that data is updated for all languages.\n## Test in the simulator\nWhen using the [simulator](/dialogflow/es/docs/console#simulator) , choose the language you want to use by selecting it below the agent name.\n## Supply a language using the API\nWhen sending requests via the API, set the `queryInput.input.languageCode` field of the `detectIntent` method. For more information, see the [Sessions](/dialogflow/es/docs/reference/common-types#sessions) type.\n## Requests that do not supply an agent's language\nWhen Dialogflow receives a request that does not supply a language supported by the agent, the following rules apply:\n- When a request does not supply a language, Dialogflow handles the request using the default language.\n- When a request supplies a locale-specific language that is not supported by the agent, but the associated root language is supported by the agent, Dialogflow handles the request using the root language.\n- System entity extraction is an exception to the previous rule. System entity extraction uses the supplied locale-specific language, even if the locale-specific language is not supported by the agent.## Integrations\nAgent interactions through text-based and phone gateway [integrations](/dialogflow/es/docs/integrations) only use the default language of the agent.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
