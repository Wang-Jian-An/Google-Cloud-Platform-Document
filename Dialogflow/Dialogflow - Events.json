However, you can also trigger intents using . Events can be invoked in many ways.\nThere are two types of events:\n- [Platform events](/dialogflow/docs/events-platform) : These built-in events are provided by platform [integrations](/dialogflow/docs/integrations) . They are invoked when platform-specific events occur. For example, the`FACEBOOK_LOCATION`event is invoked by the Facebook integration when an end-user accepts or rejects a request for the end-user's location.\n- [Custom events](/dialogflow/docs/events-custom) : These are events that you define. You can invoke these events using either [fulfillment](/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-overview) or [the API](/dialogflow/docs/api-overview) . For example, you might set a timed alert during a conversation, which invokes an event at a certain time. This event could trigger an intent that alerts the end-user about something.", "content": "## Configure an intent for events\nEvents are identified simply by their name. Platform-specific events have specific names, but you can name custom events anything.\nTo configure an intent so that it is triggered when certain events are invoked:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow ES Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com) .\n- Select an agent.\n- Select **Intents** in the left sidebar menu.\n- Select an intent.\n- Expand thesection.\n- Enter one or more event names.\nTo update intent events with the API, see the [Intents](/dialogflow/docs/reference/common-types#intents) type.\n## Event parameters\nWhen invoked, events may also have parameter data that you can access in the triggered intent's responses.
