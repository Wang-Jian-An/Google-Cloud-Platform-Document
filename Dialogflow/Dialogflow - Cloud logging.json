You can also control the [region](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region) in which these logs are stored.\n", "content": "## Enable Cloud logging\nTo enable or disable Cloud logging for your agent, see the logging options in the [agent's general settings](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent#settings-general) .\n## Viewing Cloud logs\nOnce you enable Cloud logging for an agent, you can browse these logs using the [Cloud Logs Explorer](/logging/docs/view/logs-explorer-interface) .\n## Log format\nFor detailed information on the log format, see [Log entry structure](/logging/docs/api/platform-logs#structure) .\nThe following is a partial list of log entry titles used by Dialogflow:\n- Dialogflow Request\n- Dialogflow Response\n- Dialogflow webhook request\n- Dialogflow webhook response\n- Dialogflow webhook error\n`jsonPayload`\n[Dialogflow reference documentation](/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference)\n## Regionalization\nBy default, Dialogflow Cloud log entries are routed to the [_Default logs bucket](/logging/docs/buckets) , which is global. If you have data residency requirements for your project, you can route your logs to a region-specific logs bucket. For instructions, see [regionalizing your project's logs using logs buckets](/logging/docs/regionalized-logs) .\n**Note:** When redirecting log sinks, you can use `LOG_ID(\"dialogflow-runtime.googleapis.com/requests\")` for filtering Dialogflow Cloud logs.\n## Limitations\nIf Dialogflow response exceeds the Cloud logging log entry size [limit](/logging/quotas) , the `QueryResult.diagnosticInfo` field is not included in the logs.\nAt most 500 turns will be logged for each conversation.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
