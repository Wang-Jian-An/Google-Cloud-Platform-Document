You can also control the [region](/dialogflow/es/docs/how/region) in which these logs are stored.\n", "content": "## Enable Cloud logging\nTo enable or disable Cloud logging for your agent, see the logging options in the [agent's general settings](/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-settings#general) .\n## Viewing Cloud logs\nOnce you enable Cloud logging for an agent, you can browse these logs using the [Cloud Logs Explorer](/logging/docs/view/logs-explorer-interface) .\n**Open logs**\n[agent's general settings](/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-settings#general)\n## Log format\nFor detailed information on the log format, see [Log entry structure](/logging/docs/api/platform-logs#structure) .\nThe following is a partial list of log entry titles used by Dialogflow:\n- Dialogflow Request\n- Dialogflow Response\n- Dialogflow fulfillment request\n- Dialogflow fulfillment response\n- Dialogflow fulfillment error\n`textPayload`\n[HOCON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOCON)\n[Dialogflow reference documentation](/dialogflow/es/docs/reference)\n## Regionalization\nBy default, Dialogflow Cloud log entries are routed to the [_Default logs bucket](/logging/docs/buckets) , which is global. If you have data residency requirements for your project, you can route your logs to a region-specific logs bucket. For instructions, see [regionalizing your project's logs using logs buckets](/logging/docs/regionalized-logs) .\n**Note:** When redirecting log sinks, you can use `LOG_ID(\"dialogflow-runtime.googleapis.com/requests\")` for filtering Dialogflow Cloud logs.\n## Log analysis tools\nLooker provides a tool that can help with analyzing log data:\n- [Dialogflow Parser by Looker](https://marketplace.looker.com/marketplace/detail/dialogflow-parser) (overview of the tool)\n- [stacklogs-looker](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dialogflow-integrations/tree/master/stacklogs-looker) (instructions for the tool)", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
