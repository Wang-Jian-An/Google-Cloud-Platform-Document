{"title": "Dialogflow - Prebuilt agents", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agents-prebuilt", "abstract": "# Dialogflow - Prebuilt agents\nPrebuilt agents are a collection of agents provided by Dialogflow for common use cases. Similar to [Dialogflow ES prebuilt agents](/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-prebuilt) , these can be used to establish a base for building conversations. In Dialogflow CX, you will find popular use cases across industries, such as telecommunications, financial services, healthcare, retail, and travel. [Generative prebuilt agents](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/generative/prebuilt-agent) are also available with limited access, demonstrating common use cases implemented using [generative features](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/generative) .\nPrebuilt agents include [intents](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/intent) and [entities](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/entity) for their use cases, but you need to modify the example [route groups](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/handler#route-group) and [fulfillment](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/fulfillment) (where applicable).\n**Note:** Importing a prebuilt agent creates a new agent. If you want to include prebuilt agent functionality in an existing agent, you can [export flows](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/flow#export) from the newly created prebuilt agent and [import](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/flow#import) them to your existing agent.\n", "content": "## Limitations\nThe following limitations apply:\n- Prebuilt agents currently only support English (en).## Import a prebuilt agent\nTo import a prebuilt agent to your project:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow CX Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx/projects) .\n- Click the project where you would like to import the prebuilt agent.\n- Click **Use pre-built agents** .\n- Click the agent of interest and click **Import** .\n- Choose your desired [location](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail) and click **Create** .\n- Start testing and customizing.## Customize the imported prebuilt agent\n- [Test the agent](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/console#simulator) using the simulator to understand what it can help users accomplish.\n- Click the **Manage** tab in the left pane and then **Test Cases** to see coverage and example scripts. For more information, see the [Test cases](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/test-case) documentation.\n- [Delete any flows](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/flow#delete) that are irrelevant to your use case.\n- Edit agent dialogue and [custom entities](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/entity-custom) to meet your business needs.\n- If there is [webhook source code](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/webhook) , see [Modifying webhook code](#modify-webhook) .## Modifying webhook code\nA selection of the prebuilt agents utilize webhooks. The original webhook source code uses Node.js and is hosted in Google's internal Cloud Functions project.\nTo use and modify this code in your own Cloud Functions project, please follow the subsequent directions:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow CX Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx/projects) .\n- Click the project where you would like to import the prebuilt agent.\n- Click **Use pre-built agents** .\n- Click the agent of interest then click **Documentation link** , which will bring you to the relevant pre-built agent section of this document.\n- See the **Webhook** subsection for the prebuilt agent and copy the source code.\n- Go to the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select **Cloud Functions** on the left panel.\n- Click the project where you would like to import the source code.\n- Click **Create Function** . For further instructions, take a look at the [Create a Cloud Function](/functions/docs/create-deploy-nodejs#create_a_function) documentation.\n- Under the **Source code** section, select **Inline Editor** and paste the copied source code.\n- Click **Source** and then **Edit** to change the logic based on your business rules. Once finished, click **Deploy** .\n- Click **Trigger** and copy the **Trigger URL** .\n- Replace that Trigger URL in your agent by going to **Manage > Webhooks** and selecting the webhook to paste the new URL into. Paste the Trigger URL into the field labeled Webhook URL. Click **Save** .\n- Using the [Webhooks](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/webhook) documentation, test your fulfillment.## Financial services agent\nThis template helps end-users with their cards, checks an application status, and investigates suspicious charges.\n### Sample utterances\n### Webhook\nThe Cloud Functions webhook performs the following actions:\n- Validates an end-user's identity\n- Provides sample balances, loan status, and credit card feature information\n- Mocks sample payments, including validating payment amounts and dates\n- Controls opening hours## Healthcare agent\nThis template helps end-users check their claims, benefits, and find a doctor.\n### Sample utterances## Order and account management agent\nThis template helps end-users purchase or return a product, track orders, and manage account settings, such as loyalty points, addresses, and passwords.\n### Sample utterances## Payment arrangement agent\nThis template helps end-users set up a two installment payment arrangement or extend a payment due date.\n### Sample utterances\n### Webhook\nThis Cloud Functions webhook performs the following actions:\n- Provides sample amount due and maximum extension dates.\n- Calculates the second payment installment based on the difference between the total balance and the first payment installment paid.\n- Validates that the requested extension date does not surpass the maximum extension date.## Small talk agent\nThis template helps customize and personalize agents with simple questions.\n### Sample utterances## Telecommunications agent\nThis template helps end-users resolve billing and plan questions, troubleshoot, and add travel and cruise plans.\n### Sample utterances\n### Webhook\nThe Cloud Functions webhook performs the following actions:\n- Compares plan costs based on a trip location and duration\n- Identifies billing anomalies based on an end-user's phone number\n## Travel: baggage claim agent\nThis template helps end-users create or check the status of a claim related to lost, delayed, or damage baggage.\n### Sample utterances\n### Webhook\nThis Cloud Functions webhook performs the following actions:\n- Verifies user and flight details.\n- Generates a claim ID and returns claim information.## Travel: car rental agent\nThis template helps end-users start a new car rental reservation.\n### Sample utterances\n## Travel: flight information agent\nThis template helps end-users book and change tickets, find flight information, and request a refund.\n### Sample utterances", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
