These agents can be used to establish a base for building conversations for dining out, hotel booking, navigation, etc.\nPrebuilt agents include intents and entities for their use cases, but you need to provide intent responses. Responses often depend on your specific scenario or need to be retrieved via [fulfillment](/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-overview) .\n**Note:** Importing a prebuilt agent creates a new agent. If you want to include prebuilt agent functionality in an existing agent, you can [copy or move the intents and entities](/dialogflow/es/docs/intents-manage#copy_or_move_intents) from the newly created prebuilt agent to your existing agent.\n", "content": "## Limitations\nThe following limitations apply:\n- Prebuilt agents are only available for the`global` [region](/dialogflow/es/docs/how/region) .\n- Each prebuilt agent supports a subset of all Dialogflow languages. When you are browsing pre-built agents, only the pre-built agents that support the default language of the active agent are shown.## Import a prebuilt agent\nTo import a prebuilt agent to your project:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow ES Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com) .\n- Click **Prebuilt agents** in the left sidebar menu.\n- Hover the mouse over a prebuilt agent.\n- Click **View details** .\n- Click **Import** .\n- Either create a new GCP project or choose an existing one.\n- Click **Create Agent From Template** .", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
