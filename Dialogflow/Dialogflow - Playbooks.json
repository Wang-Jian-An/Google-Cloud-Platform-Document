A playbook agent typically has many playbooks, where each playbook is defined to handle specific tasks. The playbook data is provided to the LLM, so it has the information it needs to answer questions and execute tasks. Each playbook can provide information, send queries to external services, or defer conversation handling to a Dialogflow CX flow or another playbook to handle sub-tasks.\n", "content": "## Playbook data\nA playbook is composed of the following data:\n- [Goals](/dialogflow/vertex/docs/concept/goals) : high level description of what the playbook agent should accomplish\n- [Instructions](/dialogflow/vertex/docs/concept/instructions) : defines the process steps that should be taken to accomplish the goal\n- [Examples](/dialogflow/vertex/docs/concept/examples) : sample conversations that are effectively few-shot prompt examples for the LLM## Default playbook\nWhen you create a playbook agent, a **default playbook** is created automatically.\nThe default playbook is the starting point for conversations, so it has some important distinctions from other playbooks:\n- The default playbook doesn't receive a summary of preceding conversation turns.\n- The default playbook can't define or receive input parameters.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
