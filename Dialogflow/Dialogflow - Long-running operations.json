These methods are asynchronous, and the operation may not be completed when the method returns a response. You can check on the status or cancel operations.\n", "content": "## Get an operation status\nThe following shows how to poll an operation's status. If you have many operations to check, you should rate limit your calls or use the [list](#list) method instead.\nCall the `get` method for the [Operations](/dialogflow/docs/reference/common-types#operations) type.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : your GCP project ID\n- : your operation ID\n- : either`v2`or`v2beta1`\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nGET https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/API_VERSION/projects/my-gcp-project/operations/OPERATION_ID\n```\nTo send your request, expand one of these options:You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:\n```\n{\n \"name\": \"projects/PROJECT_ID/operations/some-operation-name-OPERATION_ID\",\n \"metadata\": {\n \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.dialogflow.API_VERSION.SomeOperationType\",\n \"state\": \"DONE\"\n },\n \"done\": true,\n ...\n}\n```\nWhen the operation has completed, a `state` value of `SUCCESSFUL` is returned.\n## List and cancel operations\nIn addition to getting a specific operation, you can list and cancel operations. See the `list` and `cancel` methods for the [Operations](/dialogflow/docs/reference/common-types#operations) type.\nThe `list` results may contain operations unrelated to your current task, so be sure to filter the results.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
