The sample dialogs demonstrate behavior when the component is called via telephony, which triggers the Default Welcome Intent and the first agent response at the start of the conversation.\n### Valid CVV\nEnd-user provides a three to four digit CVV and the component accepts it.\n| User input | Agent response             |\n|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| nan   | Please say or enter the 3 or 4 digit CVV present on your card. |\n| 3434   | nan               |\n| nan   | You mentioned the CVV is 3434, is that correct?    |\n| yes   | nan               |\n| nan   | Great, I'm done with collecting the CVV.      |\n### Retries\nEnd-user provides a three to four digit CVV in the third attempt and the component accepts it.\n| User input | Agent response                           |\n|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| nan   | Please say or enter the 3 or 4 digit CVV present on your card.               |\n| 45   | nan                             |\n| nan   | I heard 45. which is not a valid 3 or 4 digit CVV code. Please say or enter the 3 or 4 digit CVV present on your card. |\n| 34   | nan                             |\n| nan   | I heard 34. which is not a valid 3 or 4 digit CVV code. Please say or enter the 3 or 4 digit CVV present on your card. |\n| 3434   | nan                             |\n| nan   | You mentioned the CVV is 3434, is that correct?                  |\n| yes   | nan                             |\n| nan   | Great, I'm done with collecting the CVV.                    |\n### Unrecognized input\nComponent exits the flow when the end-user provides unrecognized input three times.\n| User input | Agent response                                |\n|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| nan   | Please say or enter the 3 or 4 digit CVV present on your card.                    |\n| It's fine | nan                                   |\n| nan   | Sorry, I didn't get that. Can you please say or enter the 3 or 4 digit CVV present on your card again?          |\n| It's fine | nan                                   |\n| nan   | Hmm, I still wasn't able to get that. Please make sure you're saying or using your keypad to enter the 3 or 4 digit CVV present on your card. |\n| It's fine | nan                                   |\n| nan   | Sorry, I'm having difficulty understanding your response.                      |\n## Naming conventions\nThis prebuilt component uses the following naming conventions:\n| Feature     | Format           | Example        |\n|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|\n| Flow      | [Component Name]        | CVV Collection      |\n| Component Specific Intent | prebuiltcomponents[componentname][intent_name] | prebuilt_components_cvv_collect_cvv |\n| Parameter     | [param_name]         | cvv_code       |\n## Output parameters\nOutput parameters are session parameters that will remain active after exiting the component. These parameters contain important information collected by the component. This prebuilt component provides values for the following output parameters:\n| Parameter Name  | Description            | Output Format |\n|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:----------------|\n| cvv_collection_cvv | This parameter returns the CVV captured by the component | string   |\n## Basic setup\nTo set up this prebuilt component:\n- [Import the prebuilt component](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/prebuilt-component#import) .\n### Complete\nYour agent should now be set up and ready to test.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
