They are invoked when platform-specific events occur. See the documentation for your integration platform for details on platform-specific events.\n", "content": "## Welcome events\nWelcome events are invoked when a conversation is started. There are two types of welcome events:\n- **Generic welcome event** : The [default welcome intent](/dialogflow/docs/intents-default#welcome) is automatically created when you create an agent. This intent is preconfigured to handle the generic welcome event:`WELCOME`.\n- **Platform-specific welcome events** : Each platform invokes a platform-specific welcome event when a conversation starts. For example, if an end-user clicks the **Get started** button to start a chat with your Facebook Messenger bot, the [FACEBOOK_WELCOME event](/dialogflow/docs/integrations/facebook#events) is invoked.\nWhen a platform-specific welcome event is invoked, Dialogflow triggers any intent that is configured for the event. If no intent is configured for the platform-specific welcome event, Dialogflow invokes the generic welcome event, which triggers the default welcome intent.\n## Google Assistant events\nDialogflow events are referred to as \"intents\" in Google Assistant documentation. For more information and a list of events, see the [reference documentation for Google Assistant intents](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/reference/rest/intents) .", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
