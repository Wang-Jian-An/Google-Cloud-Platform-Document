A webhook allows you to validate and confirm the sequence one section at a time, making it easy for end-users to correct the agent when it mishears \"BVP\" as \"BBV\", for example.\nThe lessons in the tutorial include:\n- Using regexp entities with auto speech adaptation.\n- Building webhooks to loop slot-filling.\n- Using contexts to carry data between intents.\nThe final interaction will behave like this:\n| Participant | Dialog                    |\n|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| End-user  | Check my order.                  |\n| Agent   | What is your sequence? Please pause after a few characters so I can confirm as we go. |\n| End-user  | 12ABC                     |\n| Agent   | 12ABC. Okay, continue.                |\n| End-user  | 34DE                     |\n| Agent   | 12ABC34BE. Okay, continue.               |\n| End-user  | No that's not right.                 |\n| Agent   | Let's try again. What comes after 12ABC ?            |\n| End-user  | 34DE                     |\n| Agent   | 12ABC34DE. Okay, continue.               |\n| End-user  | That's it.                   |\nFinally, the webhook validates the full sequence and proceeeds with the rest of your flow", "content": ".", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
