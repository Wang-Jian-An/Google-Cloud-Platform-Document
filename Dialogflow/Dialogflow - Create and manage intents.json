The instructions below focus on using the console. To access intent data:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow ES Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com) .\n- Select an agent.\n- Select **Intents** in the left sidebar menu.\nIf you are building an agent using the API instead of the console, see the [Intents reference](/dialogflow/docs/reference/common-types#intents) . The API field names are similar to the console field names. The instructions below highlight any important differences between the console and the API.\n## Create intents\nTo create an intent:\n- Click the addbutton next to **Intents** in the left sidebar menu.\n- Enter a name for your intent. Your intent name should represent the end-user expressions it recognizes.\n- Click **Save** .## Delete intents\n**Warning:** Deleting intents cannot be undone. Check the intents you've selected prior to proceeding.\nTo delete an intent:\n- From the intent list, hover your mouse pointer over the intent.\n- Click the deletebutton.## Copy or move intents\nTo copy or move one or more intents to another agent:\n- From the intents list, hover your mouse pointer over the intent.\n- Select intent(s) that you want to copy or move.\n- Click **Copy** or **Move** .\n- Choose a destination agent from the drop down menu.\n- Check any of the following additional options:- **Copy related entities** : Copies or moves any [entities](/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview) that are related to the intents being copied or moved.\n- **Overwrite entities** : Overwrites [entities](/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview) with the same name in the destination agent.\n- **Overwrite intents** : Overwrites intents with the same name in the destination agent.\n- Click **Start** .", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
