If you request sentiment analysis for an unsupported language, your detect intent request does not fail, but the `QueryResult.diagnostic_info` field contains error information.\n## Detect intent\nUsing the API, you can request sentiment analysis for each `detectIntent` or `streamingDetectIntent` call by setting the `analyzeQueryTextSentiment` field to true. The response contains a `sentimentAnalysisResult` field with `score` and `magnitude` values.\n## Using sentiment in conditions\nYou can use sentiment analysis results via the request-scoped parameters when defining a condition.\nFor more information, see the [sentiment analysis parameters descriptions](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/parameter#request-scoped-sentiment) , and [Conditions reference](/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/condition#request-scoped) for how the parameters can be used in conditions.\n## Using sentiment in the simulator\nYou can enable sentiment analysis when using the [simulator](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/console#simulator-settings) .", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
