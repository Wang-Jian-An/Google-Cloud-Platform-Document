For example, national identification numbers, IDs, license plates, and so on. With , you can provide [regular expressions](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for matching.\n", "content": "## Compound regular expressions\nEach regexp entity corresponds to a single pattern, but you can provide multiple regular expressions if they all represent variations of a single pattern. During agent training, all regular expressions of a single entity are combined with the alternation operator ( `|` ) to form one .\nFor example, if you provide the following regular expressions for a phone number:\n- `^[2-9]\\d{2}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}$`\n- `^(1?(-?\\d{3})-?)?(\\d{3})(-?\\d{4})$`\nThe compound regular expression becomes:\n- `^[2-9]\\d{2}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}$|^(1?(-?\\d{3})-?)?(\\d{3})(-?\\d{4})$`\nThe ordering of regular expressions matters. Each of the regular expressions in the compound regular expression are processed in order. Searching stops once a valid match is found. For example, for an end user expression of \"Seattle\":\n- `Sea|Seattle`matches \"Sea\"\n- `Seattle|Sea`matches \"Seattle\"## Special handling for speech recognition\n**Note:** Enabling [auto speech adaptation](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/speech-adaptation) is recommended when using regexp entities. Also see the speech adaptation [regexp-specific guidelines](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/speech-adaptation#regexp-entities) .\nIf your agent uses speech recognition (also known as audio input, speech-to-text, or STT), your regular expressions will need special handling when matching letters and numbers. A spoken end-user utterance is first processed by the speech recognizer before entities are matched. When an utterance contains a series of letters or numbers, the recognizer may pad each character with spaces. In addition, the recognizer may interpret digits in word form. For example, an end-user utterance of \"My ID is 123\" may be recognized as any of the following:\n- \"My ID is 123\"\n- \"My ID is 1 2 3\"\n- \"My ID is one two three\"\nTo accommodate three digit numbers, you could use the following regular expressions:\n```\n\\d{3}\n```\n```\n\\d \\d \\d\n```\n```\n(zero|one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine) (zero|one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine) (zero|one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine)\n```\n## Create a regexp entity\n- Open the [Dialogflow CX Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx/projects) .\n- Choose your GCP project.\n- Select your agent.\n- Select the **Manage** tab.\n- Click **Entity Types** .\n- Click **Create** .\n- Check **Regexp entities** .\n- Complete remaining fields.\n- Click **Save** .\nSet the `EntityType.kind` field to `KIND_REGEXP` .\n## Limitations\nThe following limitations apply:\n- [Fuzzy matching](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/entity-fuzzy) cannot be enabled for regexp entities. These features are mutually exclusive.\n- Each agent can have a maximum of 50 regexp entities.\n- The [compound regular expression](#compound) for an entity has a maximum length of 1024 characters.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
