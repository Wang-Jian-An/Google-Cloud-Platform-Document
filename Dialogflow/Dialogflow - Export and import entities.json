The instructions below focus on using the console. To access entity options data:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow ES Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com) .\n- Select an agent.\n- Select **Entities** in the left sidebar menu.\n- Select the **Custom** tab for [custom entities](/dialogflow/docs/entities-custom) defined for your agent or the **System** tab for [system entities](/dialogflow/docs/entities-system) used by your agent.## Format\nThe hand-editable import/export format is either JSON or CSV.\n### JSON format\nSee the [EntityType](/dialogflow/docs/reference/common-types#entitytypes) REST reference.\n### CSV format\nThe CSV content should have the following format:\n- Each entity entry is on one line and ends with a newline.\n- Each value should be enclosed in double quotes.\n- Each value should be separated by commas.\n- For a [map entity](/dialogflow/docs/entities-options#map) :- The reference value should be at the beginning of the line, followed by synonyms.\n- Include the reference value twice if you want it to be matched by the entity.\n- For a [list entity](/dialogflow/docs/entities-options#list) :- Each line contains a single value.For example, the following are two map entity entries:\n```\n\"New York City\", \"New York City\", \"NYC\", \"New York City, USA\"\"Philadelphia\", \"Philadelphia\", \"Philly\", \"Philadelphia, USA\"\n```\n## Export\nTo export an entity:\n- Hover your mouse over an entity and click the cloud downloadicon.\n- Choose **JSON** or **CSV** for the format.\n- Choose a location on your system to save the file.## Import\nTo import an entity:\n- Click the moreicon.\n- Click **Upload entity** and choose the file.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
