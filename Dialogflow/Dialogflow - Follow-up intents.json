A follow-up intent is a child of its associated When you create a follow-up intent, an output context is automatically added to the parent intent and an input context of the same name is added to the follow-up intent. A follow-up intent is only matched when the parent intent is matched in the previous conversational turn. You can also create multiple levels of nested follow-up intents.\nDialogflow provides many [predefined follow-up intents](/dialogflow/docs/reference/follow-up-intent-expressions) for common end-user replies like \"yes\", \"no\", or \"cancel\". You can also create your own follow-up intents to handle custom replies.\nFor example, a hair stylist agent might have the following nested intents.\n| Intent name   | Training phrase | Input context   | Output context   | Intent response      |\n|:--------------------|:------------------|:-------------------------|:-------------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n| Appointment   | Hello    | nan      | appointment-followup  | Would you like to make an appointment? |\n| \u2937 Appointment - yes | Yes    | appointment-followup  | appointment-yes-followup | Would you like a haircut?    |\n| \u2937 Haircut - yes  | Yes    | appointment-yes-followup | nan      | Your appointment is set.    |\n| \u2937 Haircut - no  | No    | appointment-yes-followup | nan      | Goodbye.        |\n| \u2937 Appointment - no | No    | appointment-followup  | nan      | Goodbye.        |\n", "content": "## Where to find this data\nWhen building an agent, it is most common to use the Dialogflow ES Console ( [visit documentation](/dialogflow/docs/console) , [open console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com) ). The instructions below focus on using the console. To access intent data:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow ES Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com) .\n- Select an agent.\n- Select **Intents** in the left sidebar menu.\nIf you are building an agent using the API instead of the console, see the [Intents reference](/dialogflow/docs/reference/common-types#intents) . The API field names are similar to the console field names.\n## Create a follow-up intent\nTo create a follow-up intent:\n- From the intent list, hover your mouse pointer over the desired parent intent.\n- Click **Add follow-up intent** .\n- Select one of the predefined follow-up intents, or choose **custom** . The predefined follow-up intents already include training phrases for expected end-user replies.", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
