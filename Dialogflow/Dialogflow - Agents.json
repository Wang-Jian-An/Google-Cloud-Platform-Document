{"title": "Dialogflow - Agents", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-overview", "abstract": "# Dialogflow - Agents\nA Dialogflow is a virtual agent that handles concurrent conversations with your end-users. It is a natural language understanding module that understands the nuances of human language. Dialogflow translates end-user text or audio during a conversation to structured data that your apps and services can understand. You design and build a Dialogflow agent to handle the types of conversations required for your system.\nA Dialogflow agent is similar to a human call center agent. You train them both to handle expected conversation scenarios, and your training does not need to be overly explicit.\nAgents also serve as a top-level container for settings and data:\n- [Agent settings](/dialogflow/docs/agents-settings) for language options, machine learning settings, and other settings that control the behavior of your agent.\n- [Intents](/dialogflow/docs/intents-overview) to categorize end-user intentions for each conversation turn.\n- [Entities](/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview) to identify and extract specific data from end-user expressions.\n- [Knowledge](/dialogflow/docs/knowledge-connectors) to parse documents (for example, FAQs) and find automated responses.\n- [Integrations](/dialogflow/docs/integrations) for applications that run on devices or services that directly handle end-user interactions for you (for example, Google Assistant).\n- [Fulfillment](/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-overview) to connect your service when using integrations", "content": ".", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
