{"title": "Dialogflow - Integrations", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/integrations", "abstract": "# Dialogflow - Integrations\nDialogflow integrates with many popular conversation platforms like Google Assistant, Slack, and Facebook Messenger. If you want to build an agent for one of these platforms, you should use one of the many options. Direct end-user interactions are handled for you, so you can focus on building your agent. Each integration handles end-user interactions in a platform-specific way, so see the documentation for your integration platform for details.\n**Note:** When using a third party integration, requests and end-user data are sent to both Google and the third party. The terms of service, SLA, pricing, and quotas [for your agent edition](/dialogflow/docs/editions) are applicable for Google's handling of these requests. The third party's terms of service, SLA, pricing, and quotas are applicable for the third party's handling of these requests.\nThere are multiple types of Dialogflow integrations. See each type description below.\n", "content": "## Partner telephony integrations\nThese telephony integrations are created by Google partners in collaboration with Google. Google provides no support for these integrations. You should contact the integration owner for support. These integrations require one click to enable from Dialogflow, which is followed by configuration steps required by the partner. The following are available from Google partners:\n- [AudioCodes](/dialogflow/docs/integrations/audiocodes) \n- [Avaya](/dialogflow/docs/integrations/avaya) \n- [SignalWire](/dialogflow/docs/integrations/signalwire) \n- [Twilio](/dialogflow/es/docs/integrations/twilio) \n- [Voximplant](/dialogflow/docs/integrations/voximplant) ## Dialogflow built-in integrations\nThese integrations are fully supported by Dialogflow and are configured with the Dialogflow Console.
