{"title": "Dialogflow - Integrations", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration", "abstract": "# Dialogflow - Integrations\nDialogflow CX currently provides several built-in with other conversation platforms. These integrations provide a user interface to the end-user, and they call the Dialogflow API for you. All you need to do is build your agent and optionally implement a [webhook](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/webhook) service. Each integration handles interactions in a platform-specific way, so see the specific integration documentation for details.\n**Note:** When using a third party integration, requests and end-user data are sent to both Google and the third party. The terms of service, SLA, pricing, and quotas [for your agent edition](/dialogflow/docs/editions) are applicable for Google's handling of these requests. The third party's terms of service, SLA, pricing, and quotas are applicable for the third party's handling of these requests.\nThere are multiple types of Dialogflow integrations. See each type description below.\n", "content": "## Partner telephony integrations\nThese telephony integrations are created by Google partners in collaboration with Google. Google provides no support for these integrations. You should contact the integration owner for support. These integrations require one click to enable from Dialogflow, which is followed by configuration steps required by the partner. The following are available from Google partners:\n- [AudioCodes](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/audiocodes) \n- [Avaya](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/avaya) \n- [Twilio](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/twilio) \n- [Voximplant](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/voximplant) ## Dialogflow built-in integrations\nThese integrations are fully supported by Dialogflow and are configured with the Dialogflow Console. The following are available:\n- [Dialogflow CX Phone Gateway](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/phone-gateway) \n- [Dialogflow Messenger](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/dialogflow-messenger) \n- [Messenger from Meta](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/meta-messenger) \n- [Workplace from Meta](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/meta-workplace) \n- [LINE](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/line) \n- [Slack](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/slack) \n- [Google Chat](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/google-chat) ## Google-contributed open source integrations\nThese open source integrations were contributed by Google.
