During the conversation, an end-user can click these buttons to provide feedback on the agent responses. If the user selects thumbs down, they can optionally provide a reason for the negative feedback.\n## Collect feedback with custom user interfaces\nIf you have developed a custom user interface, you can add feedback collection to your interface and call the `Sessions.submitAnswerFeedback` method.## Custom feedback data structure\nYou can have feedback data stored in your custom data structure filling the `answerFeedback.customRating` field in the `Sessions.submitAnswerFeedback` method.\nIf you use [Dialogflow Messenger](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/dialogflow-messenger) , you can set up custom feedback collection by defining your [custom feedback component](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/dialogflow-messenger#custom-feedback-component) .\n## Browse feedback using the Dialogflow CX Console\nYou can access and filter feedbacks using the [Conversation history](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/conversation-history#browser) tool.\n## Read feedback with BigQuery interaction logging\nYou can analyze the feedback data with [BigQuery interaction logging](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/export-bq) .\nIf you have already created your BigQuery table, you can alter your existing table with the following SQL command if it doesn't have the required `bot_answer_feedback` column:\n```\nALTER TABLE <your_dataset_name>.<your_table_name>ADD COLUMN bot_answer_feedback JSON;\n```\n## Read feedback with the API\nThe conversation history resource contains `answerFeedback` fields that contain feedback data.
