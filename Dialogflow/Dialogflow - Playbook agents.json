Pre-GA products and features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nPlaybook agents provide a new way for creating virtual agents using large language models (LLM). Rather than defining Dialogflow CX flows, pages, intents, and transitions; you provide natural language instructions and structured data. This can significantly reduce the virtual agent creation and maintenance time, and enable brand new types of conversational experiences for your business.\nIf you still require the explicit control provided by Dialogflow CX flows in certain conversational scenarios, you can combine the power of Vertex AI Conversation and flows in a single hybrid virtual agent.\n", "content": "## Limitations\nThe following limitations apply:\n- The following languages are supported: Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n- The following regions supported:`global`,`us-central1`,`us`. For more detail see [comparison](#comparison) section.\n- Playbooks don't support sending a [call companion](/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/call-companion) SMS from the Default Welcome Intent route in the Default Start Flow, but you can enable the call companion SMS option in standard flows.\n- Currently, the Vertex AI Search and Conversation console does not support Dialogflow CX flows.## Playbook agents versus Dialogflow agents\nOver the coming months, the generative features of Dialogflow CX will be migrating to Vertex AI Conversation. Once the migration is complete, the two consoles will have feature parity. This documentation focuses on the Vertex AI Conversation features, but the concepts are the same.\nThe following table describes the currently supported generative features for each:\n| Capability             | Dialogflow CX         | Vertex AI Conversation |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------|\n| Flows               | \u2705           | nan      |\n| Configure banned phrases          | \u2705           | \u2705      |\n| Select LLM models            | \u2705           | \u2705      |\n| Input/output parameters for playbooks       | \u2705           | nan      |\n| External API tools           | \u2705           | \u2705      |\n| Data store tools            | \u2705           | \u2705      |\n| Function tools            | \u2705 (not supported in simulator)    | \u2705      |\n| Save simulator and conversation history as example   | nan           | \u2705      |\n| Custom prompts for data store query rewrite and summarization | \u2705           | nan      |\n| Simulator for testing           | \u2705           | \u2705      |\n| Conversation history           | \u2705           | \u2705      |\n| Test cases             | \u2705           | nan      |\n| Versions              | \u2705           | \u2705      |\n| Change history            | \u2705           | \u2705      |\n| Import and export            | \u2705           | nan      |\n| Multi-lingual             | \u2705           | \u2705      |\n| Analytics              | nan           | nan      |\n| Regions              | Single-region (US) Multi-region* (US) Global* | Single-region (US)  |\n| Security and compliance          | CMEK, AxT, DRZ, VPC SC      | CMEK, AxT, DRZ   |", "guide": "Dialogflow"}
