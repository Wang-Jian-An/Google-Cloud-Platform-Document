{"title": "Dialogflow - Agent settings", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-settings", "abstract": "# Dialogflow - Agent settings\nThis page describes the various settings you can apply to an agent. To access these settings:\n- Go to the [Dialogflow ES Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com) \n- Select your agent near the top of the left sidebar menu\n- Click the settingsbutton next to the agent name\n**Note:** If you're working on a small screen, and the sidebar menu is hidden,  click the menu button in the upper left corner.\n", "content": "## Agent edition\nAgents default to Dialogflow Trial Edition. To change the [edition](/dialogflow/docs/editions) for an agent:\n**Note:** Only [project owners](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#basic-definitions) are able to change the edition for an agent in the Dialogflow Console.- Scroll to the bottom of the left sidebar menu, where the agent edition is shown\n- Click the **Edit** or **Upgrade** link\n- Select a plan\nCall the `setAgent` method for the [Projects resource](/dialogflow/es/docs/reference/common-types#agents_references) . Provide `\"TIER_ENTERPRISE\"` to the `tier` field to upgrade to the Dialogflow Essentials edition or `\"TIER_STANDARD\"` to revert to the Dialogflow Trial edition.\n **Note:** The minimal permission required for using this method is `dialogflow.agents.create` .\nIf you [use multiple projects](/dialogflow/es/docs/multi-project) , the consumer project is used to determine the edition for [quotas](/dialogflow/quotas) and [charges](/dialogflow/pricing) .\n## General\nTo access the general settings, click the **General** tab.\nThe following settings are available:\n- **Description** : Description of the agent.\n- **Default Time Zone** : Default time zone for the agent. Date and time requests are resolved using this timezone if the time zone is not provided in the API requests.\n- **Agent Avatar URI** : A URI for your agent's avatar used by some integrations.\n- **Google Project** : [GCP project](/dialogflow/es/docs/quick/setup#project) linked to the agent.\n- **Agent Webhook Protocol Version** : Visible only in [V1 API legacy](/dialogflow/docs/release-notes#June_29_2020) agents. Allows you to switch to the V2 API [webhook](/dialogflow/es/docs/fulfillment-webhook) format.\n- **Beta Features** : Toggle to enable beta features for the agent.\n- **Log Settings** :- **Log interactions to Dialogflow** : **Note:** To view or change this setting with the console, you must have the [IAM Project Owner role](/dialogflow/es/docs/access-control#roles) . To read or change this setting with the API, you must have one of the following [roles](/dialogflow/es/docs/access-control#roles) : IAM Dialogflow API Admin, IAM Editor, or IAM Owner; or a [custom role](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) containing the `dialogflow.agents.create` permission.Indicates whether [Interaction logging](/dialogflow/es/docs/interaction-logging) is enabled for the agent.\n- **Log interactions to Google Cloud** : **Note:** To view or change this setting with the console, you must have the [IAM Project Owner role](/dialogflow/es/docs/access-control#roles) . This setting is not available in the API.Indicates whether [Cloud logging](/dialogflow/es/docs/logging) is enabled for the agent. This option is only available if **Log interactions to Dialogflow** is enabled. Disabling Dialogflow's logging will also disable this setting. You can also click the **Open logs** link to open your agent's logs in Cloud logging.\n- **Delete Agent** : Completely deletes the agent and cannot be undone. If the agent is shared with other users, those users must be removed from the agent before you can delete it. See [Agent management](/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-manage) .## Languages\nTo access the language settings, click the **Language** tab.\nYou can set the default language and multiple additional languages. For some root languages, you can also add one or more locales. For more information, see [Multilingual agents](/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-multilingual) .\n## ML settings (machine learning)\nTo access the machine learning settings, click the **ML Settings** tab.\nDialogflow agents use machine learning algorithms to understand end-user expressions, match them to intents, and extract structured data. An agent learns from [training phrases](/dialogflow/es/docs/intents-training-phrases) that you provide and the language models built into Dialogflow. Based on this data, it builds a model for making decisions about which intent should be matched to an end-user expression. This model is unique to your agent.\nBy default, Dialogflow updates your agent's machine learning model every time you make changes to intents and entities, import or restore an agent, or train your agent.\nThe following settings are available:\n- **ML Classification Threshold** : To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent, you can tune the machine learning classification threshold. This setting controls the minimum [intent detection confidence](/dialogflow/es/docs/intents-matching#confidence) required for an intent match. **Note:** Before adjusting this value, you should try adding [negative examples](/dialogflow/es/docs/intents-default#negative-examples) .\n- **Automatic Spell Correction** :If this is enabled and user input has a spelling or grammar mistake, an intent will be matched as though it was written correctly. The detect intent response will contain the corrected user input. For example, if a user enters \"I want an aple\", it will be processed as though the user entered \"I want an apple\". This also applies to matches involving both system and custom entities.Spell correction is available for all languages supported by Dialogflow. **Note:** If original and corrected user input match different intents, the intent matching the original user input is selected.Warnings and best practices:- Spell correction can't correct ASR (automatic speech recognition) errors, so we don't recommend enabling it for agents using ASR inputs.\n- It is possible for corrected input to match the wrong intent. You can fix this by adding commonly mismatched phrases to negative examples.\n- Spell correction increases the agent's response time slightly.\n- Spell correction should not be used with Actions on Google.\n- Spell correction is trained on general user queries. If an agent is defined using domain-specific jargon, the corrections may be undesired.\n- **Automatic Training** : Enable or disable automatic agent training each time the agent is modified. **Note:** After [restore or import](#export) , the agent is retrained, even if the automatic training is disabled.\n- **Agent Validation** : See the [agent validation guide](/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-validation) .## Export and import\n**Note:** Dialogflow ES and Dialogflow CX agent types are incompatible. You cannot import an incompatible agent.\nTo access the export and import settings, click the **Export and Import** tab.\nThis feature allows you to export/import an agent to/from a zip file for backing up agents or transferring them from one account to another. While you can edit the JSON files directly and re-import them, editing should be done using the Dialogflow Console or API. This ensures that changes are validated by the system and keeps troubleshooting to a minimum.\nThe following options are available:\n- **Export as ZIP** : Exports the agent as a`zip`file.\n- **Restore from ZIP** : Overwrites the current agent with the supplied`zip`file.\n- **Import from ZIP** : Adds intents and entities to the current agent from the supplied`zip`file. If any existing intents or entities have the same name as those in the`zip`file, they will be replaced.\nThese options are applied to the agent draft. To export an agent version, [load it to draft](/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-versions#load-to-draft) first.\nThe following are included in the export of an agent:\n- Intents\n- Entities\n- Most agent settings (see list below for excluded settings)\nThe following are not included in the export of an agent and are not overwritten when importing or restoring:\n- Agent name\n- [Inline editor](/dialogflow/es/docs/fulfillment-inline-editor) files`package.json`and`index.json`\n- [Integration](/dialogflow/es/docs/integrations) settings\n- [Edition](/dialogflow/docs/editions) \n- [Knowledge bases and knowledge documents](/dialogflow/es/docs/how/knowledge-bases) \n- [Speech settings](#speech) \n- [Interaction logs](/dialogflow/es/docs/interaction-logging) \nMaximum agent size (unzipped content) for agent import/restore should not exceed 50 MB.\n## Environments\nTo access the environments settings, click the **Environments** tab.\nVersions and environments allow you to deploy multiple versions of your agent to separate, customizable environments. For more information, see [Versions and Environments](/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-versions) .\n## Speech\nTo access the speech settings, click the **Speech** tab.\nThese are the settings for speech recognition and speech synthesis. The following settings are available:\n- **Improve Speech Recognition Quality** - **Enable Enhanced Speech Models and Data Logging** : See [Data logging and enhanced speech models](/dialogflow/es/docs/data-logging) .\n- **Enable Auto Speech Adaptation** : See [Auto speech adaptation](/dialogflow/es/docs/speech-adaptation) .\n- **Text to Speech** - **Enable Automatic Text to Speech** : Automatically convert default text responses to speech in all conversations. See [Detect intent with audio output](/dialogflow/es/docs/how/detect-intent-tts) .\n- **Voice Configuration** :- **Agent Language** : Choose the default language for voice synthesis.\n- **Voice** : Choose a voice synthesis model.\n- **Speaking Rate** : Adjusts the voice speaking rate.\n- **Pitch** : Adjusts the voice pitch.\n- **Volume Gain** : Adjust the audio volume gain.\n- **Audio Effects Profile** : Select audio effects profiles you want applied to the synthesized voice. Speech audio is optimized for the devices associated with the selected profiles (for example, headphones, large speaker, phone call). For a list of available profiles, see [Using device profiles for generated audio](/text-to-speech/docs/audio-profiles) in Text to Speech documentation.## Share\nTo access the share settings, click the **Share** tab.\nThese settings are used to share agent access with other developers. See [Access control](/dialogflow/es/docs/access-control) for more information.\n## Advanced\nTo access the advanced settings, click the **Advanced** tab.\nCurrently, there is only one feature controlled from these settings.
