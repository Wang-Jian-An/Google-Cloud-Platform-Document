With metrics, you can perform operations in the Observability platform of GDCH such as network monitoring and server monitoring. Access dashboards in the system monitoring platform to visualize those metrics and get insights about service performance from observability data.\nSo, for other workload-specific metrics in GDCH, this section describes how to deploy custom resources in your project to configure system monitoring processes such as scraping targets and creating monitoring dashboards.\nFor a complete list with descriptions and details of the collected metrics from all components in GDCH, see [the metrics Overview](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/platform-application/pa-ao-operations/metrics-overview) ", "content": ".", "guide": "Documentation"}
