You can now use both Apigee Integration and Application Integration within the same Google Cloud project. [Learn more](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/using-application-integration)\nYou can test or publish an integration from the [integration editor](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/integrations-ui-layout) after you have added and configured the integration with the necessary [triggers](/application-integration/docs/trigger-overview) , [tasks](/application-integration/docs/task-overview) , and [edge](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/edge-overview) connections.\n", "content": "## Before you begin\nIf the integration you want to test or publish has a service account attached, grant the tester or publisher user account with the **Service account user** role on that service account.\nFor information about granting roles to a service account, see [Manage access to service accounts](/iam/docs/manage-access-service-accounts) .\n## Test an integration\nBefore you finalize and publish an integration, you can test your integration to verify if it works as intended. Testing an integration lets you experiment with the integration input variable values, and helps in identifying any faults in the integration connection flow.\n**Note:** Integrations that are configured with suspension-based tasks, such as [Approval task](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/approval-task) , [Suspend task](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/run-suspend-task) , or [Timer task](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/run-timer-task) , cannot be tested before [publishing](#publish-integrations) the integration.\nTo test run an integration, perform the following steps:\n- In the [Apigee UI](https://apigee.google.com) , select your.\n- Click **Develop > Integrations** .\n- Select the integration that you want to test.\n- In the designer navigation bar, click **Test** .If you have multiple triggers configured in your integration, then select the trigger from which you want to test run your integration. The **Test Integration** dialog appears.\n- Click **Test integration** .Apigee Integration test runs the integration and displays the execution result in the **Test Integration** dialog:- To edit the input variables, click **Edit input variables** .\n- To retest the integration, click **Retest integration** .\n- To view and inspect the [execution logs](/application-integration/docs/viewing-logs) of the test run, click **View logs** .\n- If you have [enabled Cloud Logging](/application-integration/docs/cloud-logging#enable-cloud-logging) , then to view logs in Cloud Logging, click **View Cloud logs** .\n- To edit the integration without creating a new version of the integration, click **Edit integration** .\n- To close the test operation and return to the integration editor, click **Close** .\n## Publish an integration\nPublishing an integration version deploys that integration version, and puts it in an [active state](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/integration-versions) . Any previously published version of the integration will automatically be unpublished, and all the services that rely on the previously published integration version will automatically use the latest published version.\nTo publish an integration, perform the following steps:\n- In the [Apigee UI](https://apigee.google.com) , select your.\n- Click **Develop > Integrations** .\n- Select the integration that you want to publish.\n- In the designer navigation bar, click the **Version dropdown** , and select the integration version that you want to publish.\n- Click **Publish** .Upon successfully publishing your integration, you can view and inspect the [execution logs](/application-integration/docs/integration-execution-logs) of the published integration. To view logs, click **Logs** in the toolbar of the integration editor.By default, Apigee Integration locks an integration from editing when it is published. To make any changes to the published integration, click **Enable editing** in the integration editor. Editing a published integration will create a new version of that integration.\n### Unpublish an integration\nUnpublishing an [active](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/integration-versions) integration version undeploys that integration version, and puts it in a [snapshot](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/integration-versions) state. Any services that rely on the published version of the integration will automatically be stopped.\nTo unpublish an integration, perform the following steps:\n- In the [Apigee UI](https://apigee.google.com) , select your.\n- Click **Develop > Integrations** .\n- Select the integration that you want to unpublish.\n- In the designer navigation bar, click the **Version dropdown** , and select the integration version that you want to unpublish.\n- Click **Unpublish** .After the integration is successfully unpublished, you can click **Enable editing** in the integration editor to edit the integration. Editing the integration will create a new version of that integration.## Best practice\nDefine the usability of a variable (input variable or output variable) before testing your integration.
