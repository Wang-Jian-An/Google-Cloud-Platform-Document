If the **Enable** or **Disable** buttons aren't visible, verify that you have the correct permissions to enable or disable the pre-trained APIs. To learn more, see [Permissions required to enable pre-trained APIs](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/platform/pa-user/vertex-pre-trained-apis#permissions) .\n- On the **Pre-trained APIs** page, view the status of each pre-trained API. The status is either **Enabled** or **Disabled** . If the status of a service is **Enabled** , its endpoint is displayed. You can use the endpoint to programmatically interact with the Vertex AI service. For more information, see [Use a Vertex AI pre-trained model in a JupyterLab notebook](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/application/ao-user/vertex-ai-workbench#use_client_libraries) .\nIf an API fails to enable, you might see information to help troubleshoot the API enablement failure", "content": ".", "guide": "Documentation"}
