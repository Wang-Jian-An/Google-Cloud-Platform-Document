You can now use both Apigee Integration and Application Integration within the same Google Cloud project. [Learn more](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/using-application-integration)\n**    Preview    \u2014 Data Transformer Script task ** This feature is subject to the \"Pre-GA Offerings Terms\" in the General Service Terms section   of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) .     Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nThe **Data Transformer Script** task lets you write, edit, and evaluate custom [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) templates to perform data mapping in your integration.\nFor information about the data mapping in Apigee Integration, see [Data mapping overview](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/data-mapping-overview) .\n", "content": "## Configure the Data Transformer Script task\nTo add a **Data Transformer Script** task to your integration, perform the following steps:\n- In the [Apigee UI](https://apigee.google.com) , select your.\n- Click **Develop > Integrations** .\n- Select an existing integration or create a new integration by clicking **Create Integration** .If you are creating a new integration:- Enter a name and description in the **Create Integration** dialog.\n- Select a **Region** for the integration from the list of supported regions.\n- Click **Create** .\nThis opens the integration in the .\n- In thenavigation bar, click **+Add a task/trigger > Tasks** to view the list of available tasks.\n- Click and place the **Data Transformer Script** element in the integration editor.\n- Click the **Data Transformer Script** element on the designer to view the **Data Transformer Script** task configuration pane.\n- Click **Open Data Transformer Script editor** .\n- The **Data Transformer Script editor** appears displaying a default commented Jsonnet template example.\n- Write your Jsonnet code and close the editor once complete. Any changes will be autosaved.## Using the Data Transformer Script editor\nYou can use the **Data Transformer Script editor** to [access](#access) the integration variables, perform variable assignments, and add or modify variables in your integration. The **Data Transformer Script editor** provides the following features to enrich your scripting experience:\n- Syntax/code highlighting, indentation, and line numbering for easier code readability and structure recognition.\n- A minimap that displays a high-level overview of the script code and helps with quick navigation.\n- Click-to-copy option to copy the script code to the clipboard.To open the editor, go to the **Data Transformer Script** task configuration pane and click **Open Data Transformer Script Editor** .\nThe **Data Transformer Script editor** by default imports ` [functions](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/data-transformer-functions-reference) ` , a predefined custom library containing a set of Jsonnet functions for data mapping in Apigee Integration. For details of the available custom functions, see [Data Transformer functions](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/data-transformer-functions-reference) .\nThe following image shows the sample layout of the **Data Transformer Script editor** :### Access integration variables\nTo read an existing integration variable from the **Data Transformer Script editor** use the ` **extVar** ` function from the predefined ` [functions](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/data-transformer-functions-reference) ` library.\n**Caution:** Jsonnet doesn't allow using hyphens (-) as part of an identifier name. For example, a variable name or a function name. If you want to use a hyphen (-) as part of a variable name, the variable must be declared within double quotes as shown in the following example.\n## Best practices\nFor information about the usage limits that apply to the **Data Transformer Script** task, see [ Usage limits](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/system-limits#usage-limits) .", "guide": "Apigee"}
