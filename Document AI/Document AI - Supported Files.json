Reducing file sizes for lossy formats may result in a degradation of image quality and accuracy of results from Document AI.\n**Note:** Prior JPEG compressions for TIFF are unsupported. Type of JPEG encapsulation defined by the TIFF [version 6.0 specification](https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/-/commit/f0a54a4fa0cfa377f493d57ee2af393005d5bbe5) .\n### Document scan resolution\nFor most accurate OCR results from Document AI, document scans should be a minimum of 200 dpi [(dots per inch)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch) . 300 dpi and higher generally produce the best results. OCR accuracy is dependent on both the resolution and the minimum font size, along with other factors like document (and if handwritten, handwriting) quality, so testing is recommended. The [image quality analysis](/document-ai/docs/process-documents-ocr#image-quality_analysis) feature can help evaluate resolution concerns.\nNOTE: 2k x 3k pixels are required for the US driver's license back side image in order to read the barcode.", "guide": "Document AI"}
