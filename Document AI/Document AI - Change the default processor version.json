When you create a processor, the initial default version is the latest version in the stable channel. If you change the default version, incoming requests are processed using the newly selected version. If you change the default version while the processor is in the middle of a request, the request will continue to use the previously selected version.", "content": "## Explore furtherFor detailed documentation that includes this code sample, see the following:- [Managing processor versions](/document-ai/docs/manage-processor-versions) \n## Code sampleFor more information, see the [Document AI Python API reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/documentai/latest) .\nTo authenticate to Document AI, set up Application Default Credentials.
