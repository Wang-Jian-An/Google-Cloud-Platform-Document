The output can be customized based on length and format as needed.\nIn this quickstart, you create a document summarizer processor, upload a sample document for processing, and create a custom processor version to adjust the summary structure.\nLearn how to:- Enable Document AI in a Google Cloud project.\n- Create a document summarizer processor.\n- Use the processor to extract and summarize text from a sample document.\n- Create a processor version to adjust the summary structure.\nTo follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the Google Cloud console, click **Guide me** :\n [Guide me](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/document-ai?tutorial=document-ai--documentai-workbench_summarizer_console) ", "content": "## Before you begin\n## Create a summarizer processorUse the Google Cloud console to create a summarizer processor. See [creating and managing processors](/document-ai/docs/create-processor) for more information.- In the Google Cloud console, in the Document AI section, go to the **Workbench** page. [Workbench](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/document-ai/workbench) \n- For **Summarizer** , click . \n- In the **Create processor** menu, enter a name for your processor, such as `quickstart-summarizer` .\n- Select the region closest to you.\n- Click the **Create** button.\nYour processor has now been created.## Test ProcessorYou are on the **Processor overview** page of the processor you just created.\n - Click on the tab to experiment with the processor. \n- [Download a sample document](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-samples-data/documentai/Summarizer/Superconductivity.pdf) It is a PDF file containing the [Wikipedia page for Superconductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity) .\n- Click and select the document you just downloaded.\n- You are now on the **Summary** page. You can view the OCR detected text and document summarization. \n- Adjust the settings to **Moderate** and **Bulleted** respectively, then click **Rewrite** and observe the results.\n- Go back to the **Customize & build** page.\n## Deploy processor versionIf you want to use specific summarization settings when processing documents with the API, create a processor version for those settings.- The are set to the last values you used on the previous page.\n- Click on to create a processor version with the specified **Summarization settings** .\n- Enter a name for the processor version, such as `quickstart-moderate-bulleted` , and click **Create Version** .\n- Go to the tab to view the deployment status. Deployment takes a few minutes.\n- When the version is deployed, you can set it as the , or you can provide the version ID when processing documents with the API.\n- To use the Document AI API:- Follow the code samples in [send a processing request](/document-ai/docs/send-request) to use online and batch processing.- Refer to [Quotas and limits](/document-ai/quotas#processor_limits) for the number of pages supported for online and batch processing.\n- Follow the code samples in [Handle the processing response](/document-ai/docs/handle-response#summarization) to get the summarization response from the processor.\nYou have successfully used Document AI to extract text from a document and summarize it.## Clean upTo avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for   the resources used on this page, follow these steps.\nTo avoid unnecessary Google Cloud charges, use the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to delete your processor and [project](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) if you do not need them.## What's next\n- Read an overview of Document AI features in the [Basics](/document-ai/docs/basics) topic.\n- See a list and descriptions of currently [available processors](/document-ai/docs/processors-list) .\n- Learn how to build a [Custom Document Extractor](/document-ai/docs/workbench/build-custom-processor) processor.", "guide": "Document AI"}
