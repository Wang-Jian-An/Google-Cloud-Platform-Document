These roles have unique characteristics:\n- Basic roles can only be granted for an entire project, not for individual buckets within the project. Like other roles that you grant for a project, basic roles apply to all buckets and objects in the project.\n- Basic roles contain additional permissions for other Google Cloud services that are not covered in this section. See [basic roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles#basic) for a general discussion of the permissions that basic roles grant.\n- In some cases, basic roles can be used as if they were groups, which causes any principal that has the basic role to get additional access for some resources.- A basic role can be used as if it were a group when granting roles for buckets.\n- A basic role can be used as if it were a group when setting ACLs on objects.\nFor a discussion of additional access that principals with basic roles typically gain due to this behavior, see [modifiable behavior](#basic-roles-modifiable) .## Custom roles\nYou may wish to define your own roles which contain bundles of permissions that you specify. To support this, IAM offers [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) .\n## What's next\n- Learn about each [IAM permission for Document AI](/document-ai/docs/access-control/iam-permissions) .\n- For a reference of other Google Cloud roles, see [Understanding Roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .", "guide": "Document AI"}
