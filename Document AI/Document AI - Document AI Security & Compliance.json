Google Cloud has regular audits for standards such as ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, SOC 2, SOC 3, and PCI DSS.\nYou can read more about Google Cloud compliance on the [Compliance resource center](/security/compliance)\n### Is Document AI FedRAMP compliant?\nDocument AI is [FedRAMP Moderate compliant](/security/compliance/fedramp) .\n### Is Document AI HIPAA compliant?\nDocument AI is [HIPAA compliant](/security/compliance/hipaa-compliance) .\n## Data Usage\n### Does Google use customer data to improve the model(s)?\nNo. Google does not use any of your content (such as documents and predictions) for any purpose except to provide you with the Document AI service.\nAt Google Cloud, we never use, nor do we intend to use in the future, customer data to train our Document AI models.\nFor more information, see this blog post: [Sharing our data privacy commitments for the AI era](/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-cloud-unveils-ai-and-ml-privacy-commitment)\n### Will Google share the document I send to Document AI?\nWe will not make the document that you send available to the public, or share it with anyone else, except as necessary to provide the Document AI service. For example, sometimes, we may need to use a third-party vendor to  help us provide some aspect of our services, such as storage or transmission  of data, who will be under appropriate security and confidentiality  contractual obligations. We will not share the document that you send with any  other parties, or make it public, for any other purpose.\n### Will the document I send to Document AI, the results or other information about the request itself, be stored on Google servers? If so, how long and where is the information kept, and do I have access to it?\nWhen you send a document to Document AI, we must store that document for a short period of time in order to perform the analysis and return the results to you. For batch operations, the stored document is typically deleted right after the processing is done, with a failsafe [Time to live (TTL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) from a few hours to up to 7 days. For online (immediate response) operations, the document data is processed in memory and not persisted to disk. Google also temporarily logs some metadata about your Document AI API requests (such as the time the request was received and the size of the request) to improve our service and combat abuse.\n**Note:** For more information, see the [Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)](/kms/docs/cmek) page in the Cloud KMS documentation.\n### Does Google claim ownership of the content I send in the request to Document AI\nGoogle does not claim any ownership in any of the content (including documents and predictions) that you transmit to Document AI.\n### What is considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that needs to be redacted on documents before being shared with Google?\n**Note:** \"Sharing\" refers to sending documents to Google for support and professional services purposes. It does not refer to documents processed through Document AI. Such documents are treated as private customer data, much like Cloud Storage. No Google employee will ever see them nor the extracted data.\nFor document **sharing** purposes, PII is any information defined as Personal Data under applicable laws. Customers must redact the documents prior to **sharing** them with Google.\nExamples of PII include but are not limited to:\n- Date of Birth\n- Names of individuals\n- Personal Address\n- E-mail Address of individuals\n- Telephone Number(s) of individuals\n- Drivers License Number\n- National ID number\n- Drivers License Number\n- Employer Identification Number\n- Bank Account Information - Account IDs, Routing Numbers, SWIFT IDs, etc. of third parties\n- Payment Card Numbers\n- Gender\n- Ethnicity\n- Usernames, ID Numbers of third parties\n- Passport Number\n- Marital Status\n- Number of Allowances/Exemptions\n- Dependent Names\n- Vehicle Identifiers (VIN, License Plates, etc.)\n- Any other unique identifying number, characteristic or code of an individual that could identify an individual consumer, family, or device over time or across services.\n### Can I resell the Document AI API?\nNo, you are not permitted to resell Document AI service.\nYou can still integrate Document AI into applications of independent value.", "guide": "Document AI"}
