For example, the addresses `123 Main St Apt 1` and `123 Main street # 1` could be normalized to the same standardized address.\nFor each supported field, Document AI also returns a [normalizedValue](/document-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/Document#normalizedvalue) in addition to the raw extracted field. This will contain the data in a standardized format to reduce post processing.\nMost will belong to one of the following categories:\n- Money\n- Date\n- Timestamp\n- Address\n- Boolean\n- Integer\n- Float", "content": "## Sample response\nThe enriched values can be found in the [entities.normalizedValue](/document-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/Document#NormalizedValue) field as shown in the following truncated sample:\n```\n{\u00a0 \"entities\": [\u00a0 \u00a0 {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"textAnchor\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"textSegments\": [ ... ],\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"content\": \"Google Singapore\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 },\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"type\": \"employer_name\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"mentionText\": \"Google Singapore\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"confidence\": 0.69933707,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"pageAnchor\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"pageRefs\": [\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"boundingPoly\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"normalizedVertices\": [ ... ]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 },\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"id\": \"9\",\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"normalizedValue\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"text\": \"Google Asia Pacific, Singapore\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 ]}\n```\nIn the sample, the original `employer_name` \"Google Singapore\" has been normalized to \"Google Asia Pacific, Singapore\".\nIn the Google Cloud console, the enriched and normalized fields are annotated with **G** .
