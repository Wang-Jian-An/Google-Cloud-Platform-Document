Each video has companion labs which provide step-by-step guides to get experience using the features presented in the video.\n", "content": "## What is Document AI?\nWelcome to the future of documents, a series that helps you make the most of your unstructured data with Document AI. There's an enormous amount of data in the documents we interact with, such as PDFs and emails, that contain unstructured or data. Join us for this series, where we show how you can use this data to automate processes, gather analytics, and more.\n[ Document AI Introductory codelab code](https://goo.gle/3OVnmnO)\n## How to use Document AI\nWant to learn how to use Document AI? This video shows how you can get started with Document AI using the Google Cloud console or with the API using the python client library. Watch to learn about Document AI processors, and see how you can create your own.\n[ Document AI Introductory codelab code](https://goo.gle/3OVnmnO)\n[ Document AI processor management codelab code](https://goo.gle/3RqiWGJ)\n## General processors in Document AI\nIn this video, we take a deep dive into general processors. These are pre-trained and ready-to-use models designed to work on any document. Watch along and learn how to get detailed structured information from documents with general processors in Document AI.\n[ Document AI OCR codelab code](https://goo.gle/3oiqC0F)\n[ Document AI form parsing codelab code](https://goo.gle/3PHROl4)\n## Specialized processors in Document AI\nIn the previous episode, we discussed general processors in Document AI for most documents. However, did you know that there are more specialized processors for documents such as invoices, tax documents, and identification cards? In this episode, we discuss how to use Document AI for: bank statements, W2s, US passports, utility bills, ID proofing, paystubs, US driver's licenses, expenses, and invoices.\n[ Document AI Specialized Processors Codelab code](https://goo.gle/3dk025d)\n## Document AI Workbench\nPreviously, we looked at Document AI specialized processors and how they can provide intelligent insights into certain document types by providing consistent schemas and normalizing data to reduce the amount of pre/post-processing you need to perform. [Document AI Workbench](/document-ai/docs/workbench/training-overview) allows up-training of pre-trained processors and creating custom processors from scratch, without machine learning expertise.\n[ Document AI Workbench: Uptraining Guidecode](/document-ai/docs/workbench/uptrain-processor)\n[ Document AI Workbench: Custom Document Extractor Guidecode](/document-ai/docs/workbench/build-custom-processor)\n[ Document AI Workbench: Custom Document Classifier Guidecode](/document-ai/docs/workbench/build-custom-classification-processor)\n[ Document AI Workbench: Custom Document Splitter Guidecode](/document-ai/docs/workbench/build-custom-splitter-processor)", "guide": "Document AI"}
