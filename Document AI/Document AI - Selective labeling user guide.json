You can create diverse training and test datasets to train representative models.\n", "content": "## Getting suggested documents\n- Create a CDE processor and import documents.- At least 100 are required for training (25 for testing).\n- Once sufficient documents are imported and after selective labeling, the information bar should appear.\n- In case of a CDE processor with 0 suggested documents, import more to have sufficient documents in either split for sampling.- This should enable **Get suggested documents** in **Suggested category** . You should be able to request suggested documents manually from the UI.\n- There's a new filter on top to filter out suggested documents.\n## Labeling suggested documents\n- Go to **Suggested category** on the left-hand label list panel. Start labeling these documents.\n- Select **Review now** on the bar when you have suggested documents in the processor to navigate to. Start labeling.\n- Select **Auto-label** on the information bar if the processor is in a warm state. Label suggested documents.## Train after labeling all suggested documents\n- Move to **Train now** on the information bar. When the suggested documents are labeled, you should see the following information bar recommending training.## Supported features and limitations\n| ('Feature', 'Support for old processors') | ('Description', 'Might not work well with old processors with previously imported dataset') | ('Supported', 'Unnamed: 2_level_1') |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n## Feedback\nTo submit feedback, bugs or feature requests, use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZdrsJ8c-8GpiAgZ1cjFVf2kEadIrN05ZjIQtaNygt8CEcNw/viewform?resourcekey=0-BqpBXS8UKpc3BiQwKNXm9A)", "guide": "Document AI"}
