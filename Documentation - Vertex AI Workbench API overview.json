Google builds the control-plane APIs on top of Kubernetes, using the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM). The control plane performs resource management for services such as Notebook creation and deletion.\n", "content": "## About Vertex AI Workbench API\nVertex AI Workbench service currently supports only the Kubernetes-based (KRM) API. Refer to the KRM page under Vertex AI Workbench section for the User Interface (UI) equivalent functionality.\n**Note:** Currently, the Vertex AI Workbench KRM API doesn't support any functionality beyond the Vertex AI Workbench service provided in the UI. Therefore, if you choose to perform a KRM API action beyond the UI capability, there is no security guarantee or product support provided. If there is a need for supporting certain functionality on the UI, file a feature request to the GDCH product team.\n## Service endpoint\nThe following URL is the API endpoint for the Vertex AI Workbench service KRM API:\n- https:///apis/aiplatform.gdc.goog/v1\nReplace with the API endpoint of your organization admin Kubernetes cluster.\n## Discovery document\nUse the `kubectl proxy --port=8001` command to open a proxy to the API server on your local machine. From there, you can access the discovery document at the following URL:\n- http://127.0.0.1:8001/apis/aiplatform.gdc.goog/v1", "guide": "Documentation"}
