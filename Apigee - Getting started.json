For example:```\nmkdir ~/envoy-adaptercd ~/envoy-adapterexport ENVOY_HOME=$PWD\n```\n- For the remaining steps, be sure you are in the`$ENVOY_HOME`directory:```\ncd $ENVOY_HOME\n```\n- Download the [ latest release](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-remote-service-cli/releases) of the **Apigee Remote Service CLI** into`$ENVOY_HOME`. Be sure to grab the correct package for your  operating system.\n- Download the [  latest release](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-remote-service-envoy/releases) of the **Apigee Remote Service for Envoy** into`$ENVOY_HOME`.\n- Create directories to hold the extracted package contents inside`$ENVOY_HOME`:```\nmkdir apigee-remote-service-climkdir apigee-remote-service-envoy\n```\n- Extract the tar file contents into the new directories:```\ntar -xf apigee-remote-service-cli_version_platform.tar.gz -C apigee-remote-service-clitar -xf apigee-remote-service-envoy_version_platform.tar.gz -C apigee-remote-service-envoy\n```\n- Delete the tar files.\n- When you complete these steps,`$ENVOY_HOME`contains two directories:```\nls -1 .\n apigee-remote-service-cli\n apigee-remote-service-envoy\n```\n- Create the following environment variables for the`apigee-remote-service-cli`and`apigee-remote-service-envoy`directories. You will use these environment variables  throughout the documentation:```\nexport CLI_HOME=$PWD/apigee-remote-service-cliexport REMOTE_SERVICE_HOME=$PWD/apigee-remote-service-envoy\n```## \n Next steps\nYou are now ready to set up and use the Apigee Adapter for Envoy to proxy API calls with Apigee API management. The following examples show you how to use the adapter with Apigee hybrid and Apigee:\n| Example       | Description                                                               |\n|:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Istio sidecar with Apigee hybrid | Deploy the Remote Service into an Istio service mesh. The remote service provides the endpoints to the Istio sidecar proxies that are installed on your target services. This steup lets you use the Apigee Adapter for Envoy with an Apigee hybrid installation. |", "guide": "Apigee"}
