For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\nApigee hybrid collects operations metrics that you can use to monitor the health of hybrid services, to set up alerts, and so on. Apigee uses the industry-standard [Prometheus](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/prometheus-operator) add-on for metrics collection. Once collected, hybrid sends the metrics data to Stackdriver, at which point you can use the Stackdriver console for viewing, searching, and analyzing metrics and managing alerts.\nThe following diagram shows the metrics collection process:\nAs you can see in this diagram, there is one Prometheus server running per cluster, and it can run on any pod in the cluster. Prometheus scrapes application metrics data from all hybrid services and sends the metrics data to Stackdriver. You can access metrics data through the Stackdriver console.\nMetrics collection is disabled by default. To enable it, see [Configure metrics collection](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.1/metrics-enable) .\n", "content": "## About metrics\nApplication metrics data is made available on a port as an internal Kubernetes service. Data collected by this service is scraped by the hybrid metrics collector service. You can use the [Monitoring Metrics Explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/metrics-explorer) to select metrics you want to view, such as:\n- read request count\n- read request latency\n- write request count\n- write request latency\nFor example, you can create a dashboard in Stackdriver to show your metrics:", "guide": "Apigee"}
