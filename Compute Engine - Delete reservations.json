[Authentication](/compute/docs/authentication) is the process by which your identity is verified for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to Compute Engine as follows.Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:\nWhen you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and   APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:```\ngcloud init\n``` **Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI  previously, make sure you have the latest version by running`gcloud components  update`.\n- [ Set a default region and zone](/compute/docs/gcloud-compute#set_default_zone_and_region_in_your_local_client) .\nTo use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:\n- ```\ngcloud init\n```## Delete a reservation\nBefore deleting a reservation, make sure of the following:\n- Make sure that the reservation isn't tied to a [commitment](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-with-commitments) . Otherwise, deleting the reservation fails.\n- If you want to delete a [specific reservation](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-consume#consuming_instances_from_a_specific_reservation) , make sure that virtual machine (VM) instances are targeting it for consumption by doing one or more of the following:- [Delete VMs](/compute/docs/instances/deleting-instance) .\n- [Update the reservationAffinity property of the VMs](/compute/docs/instances/update-instance-properties) .\nOtherwise, you encounter [errors](/compute/docs/troubleshooting/known-issues#downsizing_or_deleting_specific_reservations_stops_vms_from_consuming_other_reservations) .\nAfter you delete a reservation, you are no longer charged for the reservation and the reserved VMs are no longer reserved for you. The previously reserved VMs continue to run and you are still charged for those VMs.\nTo delete a reservation in your current project, use the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI, or REST.\nTo delete a reservation, follow these steps:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Reservations** page. [Go to Reservations](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/reservations) The **Reservations** page opens.\n- Select the checkbox next to each reservation that you want to delete.\n- Click delete **Delete reservation** .\n- To confirm, click **Delete** .Deleting the reservation might take some time to complete.\nTo delete a reservation, use the [gcloud compute reservations delete command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/reservations/delete) .\n```\ngcloud compute reservations delete RESERVATION_NAME \\\n --project=PROJECT_ID \\\n --zone=ZONE\n```\nReplace the following:- ``: the name of an existing reservation that you want to delete.\n- ``: the ID of the project that you used to create the reservation.\n- ``: the zone where the reservation is located.\nTo delete a reservation, make a `DELETE` request to the [reservation.delete method](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/reservations/delete) .\n```\nDELETE https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/zones/ZONE/reservations/RESERVATION_NAME\n```\nReplace the following:- ``: the ID of the project that you used to create the reservation.\n- ``: the zone where the reservation is located.\n- ``: the name of the reservation that you want to delete.## What's next\n- Learn how to [view your reservations](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-view) .", "guide": "Compute Engine"}
