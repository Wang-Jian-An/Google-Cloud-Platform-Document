It manages the schedule for tenant organization upgrades.\nTo use the Upgrade API, we recommend that you use the GDCH console or `kubectl` CLI. If your application needs to use your own libraries to call this API, use the following example and the [full API definition](/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/apis/service/upgrade/v1/upgrade-v1) to build your requests.\n", "content": "## Service endpoint and discovery document\nThe API endpoint for the Upgrade API is `https://` `` `/apis/upgrade.gdc.goog/v1` , where `` is the endpoint of the GDCH API server.\nUsing the `kubectl proxy` command, you can access that URL in your browser or with a tool such as `curl` to get the discovery document for the Upgrade API. The `kubectl proxy` command opens up a proxy to the Kubernetes API server on your local machine. After that command is running, you can access the document at the following URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/apis/upgrade.gdc.goog/v1` .\n## Example upgrade MaintenanceWindow resource\nYou can interact with maintenance windows using the GDCH console and `kubectl` CLI in GDCH. There are two maintenance windows for every tenant organization, one for patch upgrades and the other for minor upgrades.\nThe following is an example of a `MaintenanceWindow` object configured to define a maintenance window for GDCH minor upgrades:\n```\napiVersion: upgrade.gdc.goog/v1kind: MaintenanceWindowmetadata:\u00a0 name: minor-upgrade\u00a0 namespace: gpc-systemspec:\u00a0 recurrence: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=1;BYDAY=SU\u00a0 timeWindow:\u00a0 \u00a0 end: \"2022-04-03T06:00:00Z\"\u00a0 \u00a0 start: \"2022-04-03T00:00:00Z\"\u00a0 upgradeType: MinorUpgrade\n```", "guide": "Documentation"}
