You can now use both Apigee Integration and Application Integration within the same Google Cloud project. [Learn more](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/using-application-integration)\nAPI triggers are used to directly invoke executions for integrations. API triggers can be used in [synchronous](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/error-handling-strategy#synchronous-and-asynchronous-error-handling) or [asynchronous](/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/error-handling-strategy#synchronous-and-asynchronous-error-handling) mode.\n", "content": "## Add an API trigger\n**API trigger**\n- In the [Apigee UI](https://apigee.google.com) , select your.\n- Click **Develop > Integrations** .\n- Select an existing integration or create a new integration by clicking **Create Integration** .If you are creating a new integration:- Enter a name and description in the **Create Integration** dialog.\n- Select a **Region** for the integration from the list of supported regions.\n- Click **Create** .\nThis opens the integration in the .\n- In thenavigation bar, click **+Add a task/trigger > Triggers** to view the list of available triggers.\n- Click and place the **API trigger** element to the designer.## Configure an API trigger\nClick the **API trigger** element in the integration editor to view the trigger configuration pane.\nThe configuration panel displays the **Trigger ID** , which is a machine-generated ID in the format `api_trigger/` `` .

Each API trigger is assigned a unique **Trigger ID** .\n## Considerations\nWhen using the API trigger, the cumulative size of all the input variables can be a maximum of 8 MB. If the size exceeds 8 MB, Apigee doesn't run the integration and you will get an error.", "guide": "Apigee"}
