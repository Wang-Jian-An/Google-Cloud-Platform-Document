With Vertex AI, you can use pre-trained and custom tooling all within a unified platform. When you register your BigQuery ML models in the Model Registry, you can manage them alongside your other ML models to easily version, evaluate, and deploy for prediction.\nWith this integration, you can choose which BigQuery ML models to register to the Model Registry. Once registered, you can deploy your BigQuery ML model to an endpoint for online prediction.\nFrom BigQuery ML you can register:\n- BigQuery ML built-in models\n- BigQuery ML TensorFlow models\nWhile BigQuery ML XGboost and ARIMA_PLUS models can be registered in Vertex AI Model Registry, they can't be deployed.\nTo learn how to integrate your BigQuery ML models with Vertex AI Model Registry, see [BigQuery ML and Vertex AI Model Registry](/bigquery-ml/docs/managing-models-vertex) ", "content": ".", "guide": "Vertex AI"}
