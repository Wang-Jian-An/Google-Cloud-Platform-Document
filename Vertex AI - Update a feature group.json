Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\nYou can update a feature group to register a BigQuery table or view as the feature data source for that feature group. If the feature group already has an associated data source, you can associate a different BigQuery table or view as the feature data source.\n**Caution:** You can update a feature group even if there are feature views and features associated with it. If the updated data source excludes a column that's currently being used for online serving or is associated with a feature view or feature, then you also need to update that [feature view](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-featureview) or [feature](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/update-feature) .\nWhile creating or updating a feature group, you have the option to add user-defined metadata in the form of labels to the feature group. For more information about how to update user-defined labels for a feature group, see [Update labels for a feature group](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/feature-labels#feature_group) .\nUse the following sample to update a feature group.\nTo update a [FeatureGroup](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups#resource:-featuregroup) resource, send a `PATCH` request by using the [featureGroups.patch](/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureGroups/patch) method.\nBefore using any of the request data, make the following replacements:- : Region where the feature group is located, such as`us-central1`.\n- : Your project ID.\n- : The name of the feature group that you want to update.\n- : URI of the BigQuery source table or view that you want to associate with the feature group.\nHTTP method and URL:\n```\nPATCH https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups?feature_group_id=FEATURE_GROUP_NAME\n```\nRequest JSON body:\n```\n{\n \"big_query\": {\n \"big_query_source\": {\n  \"input_uri\": \"BIGQUERY_SOURCE_URI\"\n }\n }\n}\n```\nTo send your request, choose one of these options:\n **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.  You can check the currently active account by running [gcloud auth list](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .\nSave the request body in a file named `request.json` ,  and execute the following command:\n```\ncurl -X PATCH \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\" \\ -d @request.json \\ \"https://LOCATION_ID-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/featureGroups?feature_group_id=FEATURE_GROUP_NAME\"\n``` **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to  the`gcloud`CLI with your user account by running [gcloud init](/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [gcloud auth login](/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) ,  or by using [Cloud Shell](/shell/docs) ,  which automatically logs you into the`gcloud`CLI.
