Such clients are usually virtual machines (VMs) running Windows or Linux operating systems, using the industry-standard [Network File System (NFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) and [Server Message Block (SMB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block) protocols.\nBoth NFS and SMB use a client-server model, in which a client (for example, a Windows VM) sends requests to a server (Cloud Volumes Service) to act on the file system. Such actions include creating or deleting files or folders, modifying files, and browsing and reading the files.\nVolumes can be shared between many clients. Windows, Linux, and UNIX operating systems include built-in SMB and NFS client software.\nNFS uses user IDs and group IDs, or Kerberos principals for Kerberized NFSv4. SMB uses [security identifiers (SIDs) for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers) . Kerberos and SMB require access to Active Directory to look up names and security identifiers.\nAll file system objects are owned by a user (indicated by a user ID or security identifier) and access permission can be attached. For NFS, these are standard [UNIX-style user and group permissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions#Permissions) . NFSv4 also offers NFSv4 ACLs as an alternative method of managing access. SMB uses NTFS permissions.\nTo learn more about how NFS and SMB work, see [Basics of NAS protocols](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/ehc/ncvs/ncvs-gc-basics-of-nas-protocols.html) ", "content": ".", "guide": "Cloud Architecture Center"}
