For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\nApigee hybrid supports [rolling updates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/) . In Kubernetes, rolling updates allow Deployment updates to take place with zero downtime by incrementally updating Pod instances with new ones.\n", "content": "## \n Components that support rolling updates\nIf you change property settings for any hybrid of the following components in your overrides file, you can use the `revision` property to signal that you want to perform a rolling update to the affected pods.\n- `runtime`\n- `mart`\n- `udca`\n- `metrics`\n- `synchronizer`\nYou can also use `revision` when you change any of the following properties:\n- `nodeSelector.*`\n- `envs.*`\n- `imagePullSecrets.*`\n- `gcpProjectID`\n- `k8sClusterName`\n- `contractProvider`\n- `org`## \n How to perform a rolling update\nFor example, suppose you want to change the current `runtime` memory from 1Gi to 5Gi:\nIn the current configuration, `revision` is set to `blue` :\n```\n...\nrevision: blue\n...\nruntime:\n replicaCountMin: 2\n replicaCountMax: 20\n resources:\n cpu: 1000m\n memory: 1Gi\n...\n```\nIn the new configuration, `revision` is changed to `green` , signaling that you want to perform a rolling update when the change is applied. The value you set `revision` to does not matter; you can use any string you wish, as long as you change it from the previous value to something else.\n```\n...\nrevision: green\n...\nruntime:\n replicaCountMin: 2\n replicaCountMax: 20\n resources:\n cpu: 1000m\n memory: 5Gi\n...\n```\nWhen you apply the change, you can use the `-c` flag to only update a specific pod. For example:\n```\napigeectl apply -f my-overrides.yaml -c runtime\n```\nOr, if you do not use `-c` all of the pods that have config changes will be updated.", "guide": "Apigee"}
