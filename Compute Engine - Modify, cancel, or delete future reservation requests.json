[Authentication](/compute/docs/authentication) is the process by which your identity is verified for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to Compute Engine as follows.Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:\nWhen you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and   APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:```\ngcloud init\n``` **Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI  previously, make sure you have the latest version by running`gcloud components  update`.\n- [ Set a default region and zone](/compute/docs/gcloud-compute#set_default_zone_and_region_in_your_local_client) .\nTo use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.- [Install](/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI, then [initialize](/sdk/docs/initializing) it by running the following command:\n- ```\ngcloud init\n```\n### Required roles\nTo get the permissions that you need to modify, cancel, or delete your future reservation requests,   ask your administrator to grant you the [Compute Future Reservation Admin ](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#compute.futureReservationAdmin) ( `roles/compute.futureReservationAdmin` ) IAM role on the project.    For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .\nThis predefined role contains     the permissions required to modify, cancel, or delete your future reservation requests. To see the exact permissions that are   required, expand the **Required permissions** section:\nYou might also be able to get   these permissions  with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or  other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .\n## Restrictions\nIn addition to the general [restrictions](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#restrictions) for future reservations, when you modify, cancel, or delete a future reservation requests, the following restrictions apply:\n- You can only modify, cancel, or delete a future reservation request from within the project where the future reservation request was created. This lets you share a future reservation request with other projects, but users with permissions for only other projects can't modify that future reservation request.\n- You can only modify, cancel, or delete a future reservation request if its procurement status allows it. For details, see the following table:| Procurement status        | Cancel | Delete | Modify |\n|:-------------------------------------------------|---------:|:---------|---------:|\n| Drafting (DRAFTING)        |  nan | nan  |  nan |\n| Pending approval (PENDING_APPROVAL)    |  nan | nan  |  nan |\n| Approved (APPROVED)        |  nan | nan  |  nan |\n| Declined (DECLINED)        |  nan | nan  |  nan |\n| Canceled (CANCELED)        |  nan | nan  |  nan |\n| Procuring (PROCURING)       |  nan | nan  |  nan |\n| Provisioning (PROVISIONING)      |  nan | nan  |  nan |\n| Fulfilled (FULFILLED)       |  nan | *  |  nan |\n| Partially fulfilled (FAILED_PARTIALLY_FULFILLED) |  nan | *  |  nan |\n| Failed (FAILED)         |  nan | *  |  nan | You can delete a fulfilled, partially fulfilled, or failed future reservation only after its end time.## Modify future reservation requests\nYou can modify a future reservation request before it reaches a procurement status of Provisioning ( `PROVISIONING` ) as long as it isn't canceled or pending approval. When modifying a future reservation request, you can't change the following properties:\n- For any future reservation:- The name of the future reservation.\n- The project where the future reservation request was created.\n- The zone where the future reservation is located.\n- For future reservation requests created by specifying an instance template:- You can't override the VM properties specified in the instance template.\n- You can't replace the instance template used to create a future reservation request with another template.To modify any of these properties, you must [create a new future reservation request](#change-other-properties) with your desired updates.\nIf you want to modify other properties, select one of the following methods:\n- [Modify a draft or declined future reservation request](#modify-draft-future-reservation) .This section explains how to modify a future reservation request with a procurement status set to Drafting ( `DRAFTING` ) or Declined ( `DECLINED` ).\n- [Modify an approved or procuring future reservation](#modify-submitted-future-reservation) .This section explains how to modify a future reservation with a procurement status set to Approved ( `APPROVED` ) or Procuring ( `PROCURING` ). If you want to modify the auto-delete option, description, or name prefix of a future reservation, you can modify them without review. Otherwise, if you want to modify other properties, you need the approval of Google Cloud.\n### Modify a draft or declined future reservation request\nIf you modify a draft future reservation request, you can save your changes or submit the updated future reservation request to Google Cloud for review. If you modify a declined future reservation request instead, you must submit the request for review.\nTo modify the properties of a draft or declined future reservation request, select one of the following methods:\n- [Modify a draft or declined future reservation request created by specifying an instance template](#modify-draft-future-reservation-instance-template) .This section explains how to modify one or more properties in a draft or declined future reservation request created by specifying an instance template. You can't modify the VM properties of a future future reservation request. Instead, you must [create a new future reservation](#change-other-properties) .\n- [Modify a draft or declined future reservation request created by specifying properties directly](#modify-draft-future-reservation-direct) .This section explains how to modify one or more properties in a draft or declined future reservation request that was created by specifying properties directly.For a future reservation request created by specifying an instance template with a procurement status of Drafting ( `DRAFTING` ) or Declined ( `DECLINED` ), you can modify the following properties:\n- Auto-delete\n- Description\n- Name prefix\n- Share settings\n- Start and end time of the reservation period\n- Total count (Number of VMs)\n**Caution:** An instance template contains project-specific settings, so you can only access and use an instance template within the same project. If you create a shared future reservation request by specifying an instance template, you can't use the same template to create VMs that can consume the auto-created reservations for the future reservation outside of the project that created the shared future reservation.\nYou can modify a draft or declined future reservation request that was created by specifying an instance template using the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI, and REST.\nTo request Google Cloud to modify a draft or declined future reservation request created by specifying an instance template, follow these steps:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Reservations** page. [Go to Reservations](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/reservations) \n- Click the **Future reservations** tab.\n- In the **Name** column, click the name of the future reservation request that you want to modify.The details page of the selected future reservation request opens.\n- To modify the future reservation request, click edit **Edit** or edit **Edit draft** .The page to edit the selected future reservation request opens.\n- Do one or more of the following:- In the **Prefix** field, enter a new name prefix.\n- In the **Description** field, enter a new description.\n- Modify the **Start time** or **End time** for your future reservation request. Make sure of the following:- The start time can't be later than 1 year from the date and time at which you submit a future reservation request for review.\n- Specify a [recommended value for the start time](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#recommended-start-time) to ensure that you have sufficient time before your future reservation enters its lock time.\n- Specify a [recommended minimum reservation period](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#recommended-minimum-reservation-period) to increase the likelihood that Google Cloud approves your request after submitting it for review.\n- In the **Share type** section, you can select either **Local** or **Shared** . If you select **Shared** , you can add or remove projects to share the future reservation request with.You can select up to 100 projects. These projects must be in the same organization as the project where the future reservation request was created (the owner project). Don't specify the owner project. By default, it is already allowed to consume the shared auto-created reservations for this future reservation request.\n- In the **Number of VM instances** enter the total count of VMs that you want reserved for the period, VM configuration, and project(s) specified in this future reservation request.When calculating the number of reservations to create for an approved future reservation, Compute Engine first checks for existing reservations. If there are existing reservations that match the approved future reservation, the number of existing reservations is subtracted from the requested total number of reservations in the request to determine the number of new reservations that Compute Engine creates. For more information, see how Compute Engine [counts and provisions reserved resources](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#count-reserved-resources) . **Caution** : Make sure to have sufficient quota for the resources that you're requesting to reserve. Otherwise, Google Cloud declines your future reservation request.\n- In the **Auto-generated reservations auto-delete** section, you can enable or disable the automatic deletion of auto-created reservations for your future reservation request. **Caution:** If the auto-delete option is enabled, all the auto-created reservations are deleted at the specified deletion time regardless if they're fully consumed or not.Optional. If you enable the auto-delete option, you can specify the date and time when Compute Engine deletes the auto-created reservations. The date and time must be after the end time of the reservation period. If you leave this field empty, the auto-created reservations are deleted within 2 hours after the end time of the reservation period.\n- Depending on the procurement status of the future reservation request that you're modifying, do one of the following:- For a draft future reservation request, select one of the following options:- To save your changes, click **Save draft** .\n- To submit the draft future reservation request to Google Cloud for review, click **Submit** .\n- For a declined future reservation request, you can only submit it for review by clicking **Submit** .If you submit a request, the **Reservations** page opens. Otherwise, the details page of the future reservation request opens.\nTo request Google Cloud to modify a draft or declined future reservation request created by specifying an instance template, use the [gcloud beta compute future-reservations update command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/future-reservations/update) .\n```\ngcloud beta compute future-reservations update FUTURE_RESERVATION_NAME \\\n --description=\"DESCRIPTION\" \\\n --name-prefix=NAME_PREFIX \\\n --planning-status=PLANNING_STATUS \\\n --project=PROJECT_ID \\\n --share-setting=SHARE_SETTING \\\n --share-with=CONSUMER_PROJECT_IDS \\\n --start-time=START_TIME \\\n --end-time=END_TIME \\\n --total-count=TOTAL_COUNT \\\n --zone=ZONE\n```\nReplace the following:- ``: the name of an existing draft or declined future reservation request.\n- ``: Optional.

To have sufficient time to optionally cancel, delete, or modify a future reservation after it's approved or before it enters its lock time, make sure to specify a [recommended start time](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#recommended-start-time) .\n- `` : Optional. The new end time of the reservation period formatted as an RFC 3339 timestamp. The reservation period must last at least 24 hours. Alternatively, you can replace the `--end-time` flag with the `--duration=` `` flag where `` is the duration of the reservation period in seconds. For example, specify `1209600` for 1,209,600 seconds (14 days).To increase the likelihood that Google Cloud approves a future reservation request after you submit it for review, make sure to specify one of the [recommended values for your reservation period](/compute/docs/instances/future-reservations-overview#recommended-minimum-reservation-period) . **Important:** Make sure that your reservation period doesn't overlap with the reservation period of another existing future reservation request with matching VM properties and zone, and that was created in or is shared with your current project.

Suppose that you want to to request Google Cloud to modify this future reservation by making the following changes:- Change the end time of its reservation period to midnight of December 31, 2023 UTC.\n- Reserve 10 VMs.\n- Specify a new name prefix.\nTo request Google Cloud to modify `fr-05` , make the following `PATCH` request:\n```\nPATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/example-project/zones/us-central1-a/futureReservations/fr-05?updateMask=namePrefix%2CspecificSkuProperties.totalCount%2CtimeWindow.endTime{\u00a0 \"name\": \"fr-05\",\u00a0 \"namePrefix\": \"new-prefix\",\u00a0 \"planningStatus\": \"SUBMITTED\",\u00a0 \"specificSkuProperties\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \"totalCount\": \"10\"\u00a0 },\u00a0 \"timeWindow\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \"endTime\": \"2023-12-31T00:00:00Z\"\u00a0 }}\n```\nAfter you submit a request to modify a future reservation to Google Cloud, you can monitor the status of the request by [viewing the details of the future reservation](/compute/docs/instances/view-future-reservations#view-details-future-reservation) .\n### Change any other properties in a future reservation request\nIf you want to change any other properties in a future reservation request before it reaches a procurement status of Procuring ( `PROCURING` ), follow these steps:\n- Do one or more of the following:- To stop Google Cloud from reviewing the future reservation request, [cancel the future reservation request](#cancel-future-reservation) .\n- To stop the future reservation request from restricting the type of future reservation requests that you can create in your current project\u2014or in the projects the future reservation request is shared with\u2014 [delete the future reservation request](#delete-future-reservation) .\n- Create a new [single-project](/compute/docs/instances/create-single-project-future-reservations) or [shared future reservation request](/compute/docs/instances/create-shared-future-reservations) with your desired updates.\n### Troubleshoot\nIf you run into errors when modifying a future reservation request, see how to [troubleshoot future reservation requests](/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-future-reservations) .\nIf you still encounter issues after troubleshooting, contact your account representative or [Google Cloud Support](/contact) .\n## Cancel future reservation requests\nYou can cancel an approved, declined, or pending approval future reservation request to stop Google Cloud from provisioning the requested capacity. After you cancel a future reservation request, you can only [view its details](/compute/docs/instances/view-future-reservations#view-details-future-reservation) or [delete it](#delete-future-reservation) .\nYou can cancel a future reservation request using the gcloud CLI and REST.\nTo cancel a future reservation request, use the [gcloud beta compute future-reservations cancel command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/future-reservations/cancel) .\n```\ngcloud beta compute future-reservations cancel FUTURE_RESERVATION_NAME \\\n --project=PROJECT_ID \\\n --zone=ZONE\n```\nReplace the following:- `` : the name of an existing future reservation request.\n- `` : Optional. The ID of the project where the future reservation request is located. If you omit the `--project` flag, the ID of the current project is used.\n- `` : the zone where the future reservation request is located.\nTo cancel a future reservation request, make a `POST` request to the [beta.futureReservations.cancel method](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/futureReservations/cancel) .\n```\nPOST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/PROJECT_ID/zones/ZONE/futureReservations/FUTURE_RESERVATION_NAME/cancel\n```\nReplace the following:- `` : the ID of the project where the future reservation request is located.\n- `` : the zone where the future reservation request is located.\n- `` : the name of an existing future reservation request.## Delete future reservation requests\nYou can delete a future reservation request only in one of the following cases:\n- The future reservation request was canceled.\n- Before the future reservation has reached the start time of its reservation period.\n- After the future reservation has reached the end time of its reservation period.\nDeleting a future reservation doesn't delete the auto-created reservations for the future reservation. If you want to delete an auto-created reservation after the end of the reservation period, see [Delete reservations](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-delete#deleting_a_reservation) instead.\nYou can delete a future reservation request using the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI, and REST.\nTo delete a future reservation request, follow these steps:- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Reservations** page. [Go to Reservations](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/reservations) \n- Click the **Future reservations** tab.\n- Select the checkbox next to each future reservation request that you want to delete.\n- Click delete **Delete reservation** .\n- To confirm, click **Delete** .Deleting a future reservation request can take up to a minute to complete.\nTo delete a future reservation request, use the [gcloud beta compute future-reservations delete command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/future-reservations/delete) .\n```\ngcloud beta compute future-reservations delete FUTURE_RESERVATION_NAME \\\n --project=PROJECT_ID \\\n --zone=ZONE\n```\nReplace the following:- `` : the name of an existing future reservation request.\n- `` : Optional. The ID of the project where the future reservation request is located. If you omit the `--project` flag, the ID of the current project is used.\n- `` : the zone where the future reservation request is located.\nTo delete a future reservation request, make a `DELETE` request to the [beta.futureReservations.delete method](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/futureReservations/delete) .\n```\nDELETE https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/PROJECT_ID/zones/ZONE/futureReservations/FUTURE_RESERVATION_NAME\n```\nReplace the following:- `` : the ID of the project where the future reservation request is located.\n- `` : the zone where the future reservation request is located.\n- `` : the name of an existing future reservation request.## What's next\n- Learn how to [view future reservation requests](/compute/docs/instances/view-future-reservations) .\n- After you reach the start time of your reservation period, learn how to [consume the auto-created reservations](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-consume#consuming_instances_from_any_matching_reservation) .\n- After the end time of your reservation period, learn how to do the following:- [Modify the auto-created reservations](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-modify) .\n- [Delete the auto-created reservations](/compute/docs/instances/reservations-delete) .", "guide": "Compute Engine"}
