For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\nThis topic describes minimum cluster configurations for Apigee hybrid. These minimum configurations apply to all of the supported [Kubernetes platforms](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.3/install-before-begin#supported-platforms) .\n", "content": "## \n About node pools\nA node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. By default, hybrid assigns all pods to the default node pool; however, you can create dedicated node pools and assign hybrid components to them as a way of distributing resources.\nTypically, you define dedicated node pools when you have pods with differing resource requirements. For example, the `apigee-cassandra` pods require persistent storage, while the other Apigee hybrid pods do not. For this reason, we recommend that you create a stateful node pool for Cassandra and a stateless node pool for the rest of the hybrid runtime services. See [Configure dedicated node pools](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.3/configure-dedicated-nodes) for details.\nThe following section lists configurations for both stateful and stateless node pools.\n## \n Minimum configurations\nUse these minimum configurations when setting up your cluster:\n| Configuration | Stateful node pool | Stateless node pool     |\n|:----------------|:---------------------|:--------------------------------------|\n| Number of nodes | 3 (per region)  | 3 (per region)      |\n| CPU    | 4     | 4          |\n| RAM    | 15     | 15         |\n| Label name  | apigee-data   | apigee-runtime      |\n| Storage   | Dynamic    | Managed with the ApigeeDeployment CRD |\n**Note: ** For **production** environments, we recommend a minimum of two clusters.\n## \n Scaling the configuration\nIf you need to scale your initial configuration based on additional capacity or throughput needs, see the following topics:\n- [Configuring Cassandra for production](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.3/cassandra-production) \n- [Scaling Cassandra pods](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.3/cassandra-scaling) \n- [Configuring dedicated node pools](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.3/configure-dedicated-nodes) \n- [Scale and autoscale runtime services](/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.3/scale-and-autoscale)", "guide": "Apigee"}
