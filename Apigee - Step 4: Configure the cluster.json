For more information, see [Supported versions](/apigee/docs/hybrid/supported-platforms#supported-versions) .\n", "content": "## \n Specify configuration overrides\nThe Apigee hybrid installer uses defaults for many settings; however, there are a few settings that do not have defaults. You must provide values for these settings, as explained next.\n- Be sure you are in the`` `/hybrid-files/overrides/`directory.```\ncd hybrid-base-directory/hybrid-files/overrides\n```\n- Create a new file named **overrides.yaml** in your favorite text editor. For  example:```\nvi overrides.yaml\n```The `` `.yaml` provides the configuration for your unique Apigee hybrid  installation. The overrides file in this step provides a basic configuration for a small-footprint  hybrid runtime installation, suitable for your first installation.\n- In`` `.yaml`, add the required property values, shown below. A detailed  description of each property is also provided below:\nMake sure the `` `.yaml` file has the following structure and syntax.   Values in are   property values that you must provide. They are described in the [table below](#tablebelow) .\n```\ngcp:\n region: analytics-region\n projectID: gcp-project-id\nk8sCluster:\n name: cluster-name\n region: analytics-region\norg: org-name\ninstanceID: \"unique-instance-identifier\"\ncassandra:\n hostNetwork: false #Set this to `true` for GKE-On-prem installations.\nvirtualhosts:\n - name: environment-group-name\n sslCertPath: ./certs/cert-name.pem\n sslKeyPath: ./certs/key-name.key\nenvs:\n - name: environment-name\n serviceAccountPaths:\n  synchronizer: ./service-accounts/synchronizer-service-account-name.json\n  udca: ./service-accounts/udca-service-account-name.json\nmart:\n serviceAccountPath: ./service-accounts/mart-service-account-name.json\nconnectAgent:\n serviceAccountPath: ./service-accounts/mart-service-account-name.json\n # Same account used for mart and connectAgent\nmetrics:\n serviceAccountPath: ./service-accounts/metrics-service-account-name.json\nwatcher:\n serviceAccountPath: ./service-accounts/watcher-service-account-name.json\nlogger:\n enabled: true\n serviceAccountPath: ./service-accounts/logger-service-account-name.json\n```The following example shows a completed overrides file with example property values   added:\n```\ngcp:\n region: us-central1\n projectID: hybrid-example\nk8sCluster:\n name: apigee-hybrid\n region: us-central1\norg: hybrid-example\ninstanceID: \"my_hybrid_example\"\ncassandra:\n hostNetwork: false #Set this to `true` for GKE-On Prem installations.\nvirtualhosts:\n - name: example-env-group\n sslCertPath: ./certs/keystore.pem\n sslKeyPath: ./certs/keystore.key\nenvs:\n - name: test\n serviceAccountPaths:\n  synchronizer: ./service-accounts/hybrid-project-apigee-synchronizer.json\n  udca: ./service-accounts/hybrid-project-apigee-udca.json\nmart:\n serviceAccountPath: ./service-accounts/hybrid-project-apigee-mart.json\nconnectAgent:\n serviceAccountPath: ./service-accounts/example-hybrid-apigee-mart.json\nmetrics:\n serviceAccountPath: ./service-accounts/hybrid-project-apigee-metrics.json\nwatcher:\n serviceAccountPath: ./service-accounts/hybrid-project-apigee-watcher.json\nlogger:\n enabled: true\n serviceAccountPath: ./service-accounts/logger-service-account-name.json\n```\n- When you are finished, save the file.\nThe following table describes each of the property values that you must provide in the overrides file.

This is the value you assigned to the environment variable ANALYTICS_REGION previously during cluster creation The apigee-logger and the apigee-metrics push their data to this region.                                                                         |\n| gcp-project-id     | Identifies the Google Cloud project where the apigee-logger and the apigee-metrics push their data.
