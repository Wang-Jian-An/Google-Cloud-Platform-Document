{"title": "Cloud Deploy - Delete Cloud Deploy resources", "url": "https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/delete-pipeline", "abstract": "# Cloud Deploy - Delete Cloud Deploy resources\nThis page describes how to delete Cloud Deploy resource, including the following:\n- [Delivery pipelines](#delete_a_delivery_pipeline) \n- [Targets](#delete_a_target) \n- [Custom target types](#delete_a_custom_target_type) \n- [Automations](#delete_an_automation) ", "content": "## Delete a delivery pipeline\nYou can delete a delivery pipeline from the Google Cloud console or using the gcloud CLI.\n### Delete a delivery pipeline using the Google Cloud console\n- In the Google Cloud console, navigate to the Cloud Deploy **Delivery pipelines** page to find the delivery pipeline you want to delete. [Open the Delivery pipelines page](https://console.cloud.google.com/deploy/delivery-pipelines) \n- Click the name of the delivery pipeline you want to delete.The **Delivery pipeline details** page is shown.\n- Click **Delete** .\n### Delete a delivery pipeline using the gcloud CLI\nIf you have a delivery pipeline without any subresources (releases or rollouts), you can delete it by running the following command:\n```\ngcloud deploy delivery-pipelines delete PIPELINE_NAME\n```\nIf the pipeline you want to delete has any releases or rollouts associated with it, you need to include the `--force` flag in order to delete the pipeline and those subresources:\n```\ngcloud deploy delivery-pipelines delete PIPELINE_NAME --force\n```\nCloud Deploy prevents you from deleting the pipeline if there's a release or rollout in a state that would cause problems if deleted. For example, you can't delete a delivery pipeline if a rollout is in the `PENDING` state, but you delete it if the rollout is in a `PENDING_APPROVAL` state. If you can't delete the pipeline, you need to reject approval, or advance or cancel the rollout to a terminal state (such as `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` ).\n## Delete a target\nYou can delete a target from the Google Cloud console or using the gcloud CLI. These two methods are described in the sections that follow.\n### Delete a target using the gcloud CLI\nWhen you delete a target using the gcloud CLI, that targets is deleted whether or not it's in use by any delivery pipeline.\nUse the following command to delete a target from the gcloud CLI:\n```\ngcloud deploy targets delete TARGET_NAME --region=REGION\n```\nWhere:\nis the name of the target you want to delete. This is the same as the value for `metadata.name` in the [target configuration](/deploy/docs/config-files#target_definitions) .\nis the name of the region in which the target was created, for example `us-central1` .\nCloud Deploy doesn't prevent you from deleting a target that's actively used by other delivery pipelines.\n### Delete a target using the Google Cloud console\nYou can delete a target using the Google Cloud console, only if that target isn't in use by an existing delivery pipeline resource. That is, if there is a pipeline with a stage that points to the target, then you can't delete the target from the Google Cloud console.\nFollow these steps to delete the target using the Google Cloud console:\n- Navigate to the Cloud Deploy **Targets** page.All available targets in your current project are displayed.\n- Click the menu icon for the target you want to delete.\n- Click **Delete target** .If the target you're trying to delete is referenced by a delivery pipeline, you can't select **Delete target** .If the target referenced by a delivery pipeline, the **Delete target** dialog is shown.\n- Type the target name in the text field provided, and click **Confirm** .## Delete a custom target type\nFrom a command shell, use the following command to delete a [custom target type](/deploy/docs/custom-targets) resource:\n```\ngcloud deploy custom-target-types delete CUSTOM_TARGET_TYPE_NAME \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 --region=REGION_NAME\n```\nWhere:\n- Is the name of the custom target type you want to delete. This is the same as the `metadata.name` property in the [custom target type definition](/deploy/docs/config-files#custom_target_type_definitions) .\n- Is the region in which you created the custom target type, for example `us-central1` .## Delete an automation\nYou can delete any automation resource created in your project. You can delete the automation using the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI:\n### Delete an automation using the Google Cloud console\n- In the Google Cloud console, navigate to the Cloud Deploy **Delivery pipelines** page to find the delivery pipeline your automation is associated with. [Open the Delivery pipelines page](https://console.cloud.google.com/deploy/delivery-pipelines) \n- Click the name of your delivery pipeline.\n- Under **Delivery pipeline details** , select the **Automations** tab.\n- Click the name of the automation you want to delete.The **Automation details** are shown.\n- Click the **Delete** button, and confirm the deletion by typing the automation name and clicking **Confirm** .\n### Delete an automation using the gcloud CLI\nFrom a command shell, use the following command to delete an automation resource:\n```\ngcloud deploy automations delete AUTOMATION_NAME \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 --delivery-pipeline=PIPELINE_NAME \\ --region=REGION_NAME\n```\nWhere:\n- Is the name of the automation you want to delete. This is the same as the `metadata.name` property in the [automation definition](/deploy/docs/config-files#automation_definitions) .\n- Is the name of the delivery pipeline this automation is associated with. All automations exist only within the scope of one delivery pipeline.\n- Is the region in which you created the automation, for example `us-central1` .## What's next\n- Find out how to [suspend a delivery pipeline](/deploy/docs/suspend-pipeline) .\n- Learn more about [automations](/deploy/docs/automation) .\n- Learn how to [use service notifications](/deploy/docs/subscribe-deploy-notifications)", "guide": "Cloud Deploy"}
