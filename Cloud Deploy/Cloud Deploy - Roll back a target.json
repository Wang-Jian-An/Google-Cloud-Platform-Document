Use `--release` to identify a specific release to roll back to. If you omit this option, then Cloud Deploy uses the last known good release to the specified target.\nUse `--rollout-id` to assign an identifier to the generated `rollout` . If you omit this, Cloud Deploy generates an ID for the generated `rollout` .- [Open the Deliverypipelines page](https://console.cloud.google.com/deploy/delivery-pipelines) .\n- Click your pipeline shown in the list of delivery pipelines.The Delivery pipeline details page shows a graphical representation of the progress of your delivery pipeline.\n- Click the more menu and select **Roll back release** .The rollback form is displayed:\n- Select the release from the **Release** field.This release is the one which you're rolling back to. The **Rollout name** is populated based on the selected release.\n- If you want, you can change the rollout name and rollout description from the default.\n- Click **Roll back** .A new rollout is created from the chosen release, and deployed into the same target.\n### Roll back even further\nYou can roll back to an earlier release than the last successfully deployed one.\nSimply run `gcloud deploy releases promote` with the earlier release and include the `--to-target` option set to the target in which you want to roll back your release.", "guide": "Cloud Deploy"}
