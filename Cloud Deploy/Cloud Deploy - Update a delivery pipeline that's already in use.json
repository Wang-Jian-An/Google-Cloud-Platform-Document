If you change a delivery pipeline configuration (including target definitions) after a release is created, that release is now mismatched from the definitions.\nPreserving resources in this way ensures they function consistently across the targets and they're not disrupted by configuration changes. However this behavior might not be what you intend, in which case you can create a new release to deploy using the updated pipeline.\nCloud Deploy returns warnings if there's such a mismatch and you try to perform certain actions, such as promote the release.\nFor more information, see [Pipeline instances per release](/deploy/docs/pipeline-instances) .\n## What's next\n- Find out how to [view delivery pipelines](/deploy/docs/view-pipeline) that's already in use.\n- Learn how to [suspend a delivery pipeline](/deploy/docs/suspend-pipeline) .\n- Find out how to [delete a delivery pipeline](/deploy/docs/delete-pipeline) .\n- Learn how to [use service notifications](/deploy/docs/subscribe-deploy-notifications)", "guide": "Cloud Deploy"}
