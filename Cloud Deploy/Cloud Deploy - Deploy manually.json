But you can also manually deploy your application to any defined target.\nYou can manually deploy a new or an existing release.\n", "content": "## Manually deploy an existing release\nIf a release is already created, you can simply promote it to the intended target:\n```\ngcloud deploy releases promote --release=RELEASE_NAME \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--delivery-pipeline=PIPELINE_NAME \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--to-target=TARGET_NAME \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--region=REGION\n```\nWhere:\n- is the name of the release which you're manually promoting to the intended target.\n- is the name of the delivery pipeline that describes the automated deployment progression you're overriding.\n- is the name of the target you're manually deploying to.\n- is the name of the region in which the release was created, for example `us-central1` . This is required.## Manually deploy a new release\nBy default, when you create a release Cloud Deploy automatically deploys it to the first target in the promotion sequence. But you can specify a target other than the first one.\nAs with the default first target in the progression, Cloud Deploy automatically creates the `rollout` for the specified target and deploys the release there.\nTo manually deploy a new release, run the following command:\n```\ngcloud deploy releases create \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--release=RELEASE_NAME \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--delivery-pipeline=PIPELINE_NAME \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--to-target=TARGET_NAME \\\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--region=REGION\n```\nWhere:\n- is the name of the release which you're manually promoting to the intended target.\n- is the name of the delivery pipeline that describes the automated deployment progression you're overriding.\n- is the name of the target you're manually deploying to.\n- is the name of the region in which to create the release, for example `us-central1` . This is required.## Effect of manual deployment on the progression\nWhen you manually deploy to a specific target and then promote the release without specifying a target, Cloud Deploy promotes it to the correct next target in the progression. This is because the service tracks the furthest target to which a release has been deployed. If the release is already in the last target in the progression, Cloud Deploy returns a message indicating there is no further target to promote to.", "guide": "Cloud Deploy"}
