The location where you create a delivery pipeline determines which Cloud Deploy instance stores and processes requests for that pipeline.\nThe [Cloud Locations page](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations) lists supported regions for each Google Cloud product, including Cloud Deploy.\n**Note:** you must create targets, releases, and rollouts in the same region in which you created the delivery pipeline. (GKE and GKE Enterprise clusters represented by those targets, however, can be in any region.)\nWhen Cloud Deploy uses other Google Cloud resources for a pipeline, it creates them in the same location if possible, including Cloud Storage buckets, for example, which Cloud Deploy uses to store rendered configuration manifests.\nCloud Deploy instances can deploy applications to locations other than the one where Cloud Deploy is running. This capability allows your delivery pipelines to deploy to multiple regions. However, a given delivery pipeline is only accessible by a single Cloud Deploy instance.\nCloud Deploy instances operate independently, so a failure in one region doesn't affect an instance in another. For this reason, if you are only deploying to a single region, we recommended (but don't require) that you create your pipeline in the same location as your target cluster.\n**Note:** your choice of region can have an impact on performance and billing, because data transfers among Google Cloud locations can perform better or worse, depending on location", "content": ".", "guide": "Cloud Deploy"}
