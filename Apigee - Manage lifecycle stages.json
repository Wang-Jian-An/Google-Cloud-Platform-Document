Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.    For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](/products#product-launch-stages) .\n**Required permissions:** You must have [administrator permissions](/apigee/docs/api-hub/permissions#roles) to view the **Settings** page and manage lifecycle stages.\nThe **Lifecycle** settings page allows Administrators to define an ordered set of stages that  an API should progress through, from conception to end-of-life. Since each version of an API  usually moves through its own lifecycle separately, we don't directly set the lifecycle stage of  an API, but instead allow each API version to have an assigned lifecycle stage.\nAn **API Lifecycle stage** is defined by a **Name** , **Description** , and optional **URL** . The URL can be used to provide a link to documentation about the specific lifecycle  stage.\nThe default **API Lifecycle stages** provided are as follows:\n- **Concept:** Description of the business case and user needs for why an API should exist\n- **Design:** Definition of the interface details and proposal of the API contract\n- **Develop:** Implementation of the service and its API\n- **Preview:** Staging of implementations in the pre-production phase\n- **Production:** API available for production workloads\n- **Deprecated:** API not recommended for new consumers\n- **Retired:** API no longer available for use", "content": "## Add lifecycle stage\nTo add a lifecycle stage:\n- In the Google Cloud console console, go to the **API hub** , **Settings** , **Lifecycle** page. [   Go to API hub lifecycle](https://console.cloud.google.com/apigee/hub/settings/lifecycle) \n- Click **Add lifecycle stage** .\n- Specify the following:- **ID:** A name for an API resource. The ID can contain only lowercase letters,    numbers, and hyphens. The ID must be unique in the project. IDs must be between    4 and 63 characters long. IDs cannot be changed once a lifecycle stage has been created.\n- **Name:** A name for the stage, for example: **Concept** or **Retired.** \n- **Description:** A short explanation of the lifecycle stage. This text is displayed    in the UI as a tooltip.\n- **URL:** Enter a full URL that provides more detailed information about a    lifecycle stage.\n- Click **Save** (or **Cancel** ).## Edit lifecycle stage\nTo edit a lifecycle stage:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **API hub** , **Settings** , **Lifecycle** page. [   Go to API hub lifecycle](https://console.cloud.google.com/apigee/hub/settings/lifecycle) \n- Clickmore_vert **More** >edit **Edit** next to the desired lifecycle stage.\n- Make modifications as necessary.\n- Click **Save** (or **Cancel** ).## Delete lifecycle stage\nTo delete a lifecycle stage:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **API hub** , **Settings** , **Lifecycle** page.

Replacing a lifecycle stage changes all APIs that currently indicate they are in the    selected lifecycle stage to the new one.\n- Click **Delete** . Deleting without selecting a replacement lifecycle stage moves    all APIs with the selected lifecycle stage to a **Not specified** lifecycle    stage.\n## Reorder lifecycle stage list\nLifecycle stages appear within the UI in the order they are listed on the **Lifecycle** pane.\nTo reorder the lifecycle stages list:\n- In the Google Cloud console, go to the **API hub** , **Settings** , **Lifecycle** page.
